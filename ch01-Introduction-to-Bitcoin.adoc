[[ch01,Chapter 1]]
== Introduction to Bitcoin
:imagedir: {baseimagedir}/ch01

This chapter covers

* getting to know Bitcoin
* following a Bitcoin payment
* problems solved by Bitcoin

This book will hopefully teach you enough about Bitcoin so that you
can make informed decisions on how you can use Bitcoin to improve your
private life or your business. My hope is that you will learn
enough to make up your own mind whether you trust Bitcoin or not,
hopefully the former. In order to get you off the ground, I'm going to
assume that you know roughly what the following terms mean:

* computer program
* database
* computer network
* web server

If you're unsure of any of these terms, don't worry. Either look them
up or just go ahead anyway, I think you'll manage.

=== What is Bitcoin?

[.inbitcoin]
.Bitcoin or bitcoin?
****
The system is named Bitcoin with capital B. The currency unit is
called bitcoin with lowercase b. Commonly used symbols for bitcoin are
{btc}, BTC and XBT. We will mostly use BTC in this book.
****

Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. It allows for people or
computers to move bitcoins, the currency of Bitcoin, between each
other without using a bank or some other trusted third party. It
resembles traditional bank notes and coins in that way, but it is
purely electronic and used over the Internet. The Bitcoin currency is
not tied to any specific _fiat currency_ like the US dollar or the
Chinese Renminbi; It has free floating exchange rates against all fiat
currencies. You can buy and sell bitcoins for fiat currencies on
several exchanges. No government or company is controlling
Bitcoin. Instead, thousands of computers around the globe, the Bitcoin
network, collectively keep the system working day and night, seven
days a week. You don't need to register or sign up anywhere to use
Bitcoin, you just need a computer program, like a mobile app to
use it.

Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym whose identity is unknown, published a
scientific paper on an e-mail list for cryptography related
discussions in October 2008. The title of the paper was "Bitcoin: A
Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", see <<web-bitcoin-paper>>, and it
described the vital parts of Bitcoin. Later, in January 2009, Nakamoto
published the first software program to implement the described
system. Bitcoin didn't get much attention then, apart from within a
very limited set of cryptography experts. But gradually, as the system
proved itself to be working, more people got interested in it.

[.inbitcoin]
.The Bitcoin network
****
image::{imagedir}/2ndcol-bitcoin-network.svg[]
****

Today, in 2017, several millions of people are aware of Bitcoin,
hundreds of thousands people are actively using Bitcoin and thousands
of professionals are working on developing Bitcoin related
technology. Bitcoin is primarily used for payments, savings and
speculation today. It removes friction in online payments, especially
internationally, and it allows for anyone to use or participate in the
Bitcoin network without special permission from a bank or similar
institution.

The Bitcoin ecosystem consists of several actors. These are the most common
types of actors:

.The Bitcoin network and some different actors who use the network.
image::{imagedir}/actors.svg[{big-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.Bitcoin doesn't care
****
The Bitcoin network doesn't distinguish between actors. The actors are
just using Bitcoin in different ways.
****

Saver:: Saves bitcoin for future use.
Shopper:: A person buying goods and services for bitcoin.
Merchant:: For example a restaurant accepting bitcoin payments.
Worker:: Someone getting her salary in bitcoin.
Exchange:: A commercial service people can use to exchange their local
currency to and from bitcoin.
Trader:: A short term speculator performing trading on an exchange.

The Bitcoin network's job is to process Bitcoin payments. The network
consists of thousands of computers that we call nodes. Any of the
actors can participate actively in the Bitcoin network by running
their own Bitcoin node. You must run your own node if you don't want
to trust others to provide you with correct financial information.

=== The big picture

The Bitcoin network validates and confirms payments between Bitcoin
users. The Bitcoin network is a network of computers running Bitcoin
software.

Suppose that Alice wants to make a Payment of 1 BTC to Bob. The
payment starts with Alice asking the Bitcoin network to move money
from her to Bob.

[.inbitcoin]
.I thought Bitcoin was anonymous?
****
Bitcoin doesn't use names or any other personal information, but we
use names in this first illustration.
****

.A Bitcoin payment. The payment is processed in 4 steps.
image::{imagedir}/payment-overview.svg[{full-width}]

Let us follow Alice's payment from Alice to Bob:

. Alice asks the Bitcoin network to move 1 bitcoin from her to Bob.
. The computers in the network check that Alice actually has the
money to send and that she is authorized to send them.
. Each computer update its own copy of the Bitcoin ledger with the
new payment information.
. The network notifies Bob that he has received 1 bitcoin.

Note how Alice does not really _send_ 1 bitcoin to Bob, but asks the
Bitcoin network to move 1 bitcoin from Alice to Bob in the Bitcoin
ledger. The Bitcoin ledger is a database that each computer in the
Bitcoin network has a copy of.

We will go through these steps a bit closer in the next four sections,
one step per section.

[id=overview-transactions]
==== Step 1 - Transactions

[.gbinfo]
.Transaction
****
A transaction is a payment. Sometimes we also say transfer. We will
use the terms interchangeably.
****

Step 1 of the process is when Alice asks the network to move 1 bitcoin
to Bob. She asks by sending a Bitcoin _transaction_ to the Bitcoin
network. The transaction contains information on how the money moves
and a proof that Alice actually is authorized to move the money. Let
us start with an analogy.

[id=bitcoin_payment]
.A Bitcoin transaction
image::{imagedir}/transaction_mailbox.jpg[{half-width}]

[.gbinfo]
.Public and Private keys
****
Alice's mailbox key is her _private key_. The number on her mailbox is
her _public key_. Chapter 2 and 4 are your friends here.
****

The Bitcoin _transaction_, can be regarded as transferring money from
one locked mailbox to another. Yes, we are talking about _physical_
mailboxes for this analogy. Only the owner of the key to a mailbox
will be able to pull money out of that mailbox, but anyone is able to
put money into the mailbox through the slot. Alice, the owner of the
key to mailbox 321 in the picture, will withdraw 1 BTC from mailbox
321 and deposit the bitcoin into mailbox 560, Bob's mailbox. She is
the only one who can do that because only she has the key to
mailbox 321. In digital form, this transaction is a piece of data
specifying

* the mailbox to withdraw from (321)
* the amount to withdraw (1 BTC)
* what mailbox to move the money to (560).
* a _digital signature_

[.gbinfo]
.Digital signatures
****
We discuss digital signatures in-depth in chapter 2.
****

The digital signature corresponds to Alice _opening mailbox 321 with
her key_. Only she can open mailbox 321, only she can create the
digital signature.

Alice sends this transaction to one or more _Bitcoin nodes_, computers
in the Bitcoin network. This is the moment where Alice asks the
network to move money in step 1.

==== Step 2 - The Bitcoin network

Alice have already sent a transaction to one or more Bitcoin nodes. In
step 2 of the process, each node checks that the transaction is valid
and if it is, pass it on to other nodes. They check validity by
consulting their local copy of the ledger, and check that

[.gbinfo]
.Transparent mailboxes
****
The mailboxes are transparent. Anyone can see the contents of the
mailboxes, but only the key holder can take out bitcoins from it.
****

* mailbox 321 contains the money she wants to spend.
* Alice has successfully unlocked the mailbox, meaning that her
  digital signature is valid.

[id=overview-bitcoin-network]
.The Bitcoin network. Alice sends her transaction to a node in the network. The node will validate the transaction and forward it to other peers. Eventually the transaction have reached all nodes in the network.
image::{imagedir}/bitcoin-network.svg[{half-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.Bad transactions
****
Invalid transactions are dropped. They will not reach further than the
first node.
****

Each node doing these checks are part of the Bitcoin network. Nodes
connect to other nodes and together they form a network, the
Bitcoin network.

If all checks pass, a node will forward the transaction to the nodes
it is connected to in the Bitcoin network. Alice's transaction would
shortly have traveled the whole network while being validated by each
node along the way. The ledger has not been updated yet, that's the
next step.

==== Step 3 - The blockchain

[.inbitcoin]
.The blockchain
****
The names comes from how the ledger is structured. It uses blocks that
are chained together in a way that modifications to the blockchain can
be detected. More on that in <<ch06>>.
****

In step 3 nodes update their local copies of the Bitcoin ledger with
the information in Alice's transaction. The ledger is called _the
blockchain_. The blockchain contains historic information about
previous transactions, and new transactions are added to it every now
and then. The computers in the Bitcoin network constantly try to keep
their blockchains up to date with each other.

It is not as straight forward as it may seem to update the blockchain
with Alice's transaction. Alice's transaction is not the only
transaction that goes on. There are possibly thousands of transactions
in-flight at the same time in the Bitcoin network. If all nodes would
just update their copy of the blockchain as they receive transactions
the copies would not remain copies for long. The transactions may come
in different order on different nodes:

[id=transaction-ordering]
.Transactions arrives in different order at different nodes. If they would all write the transactions to the blockchain, the different nodes' blockchains would differ.
image::{imagedir}/transactions-unordered.svg[{half-width}]

[.gbfaq]
.Why is ordering important?
****
If transactions come in different order, it's very hard to validate if
two copies of the blockchain are equal. Integrity checks are much
easier with strict ordering.
****

To coordinate the ordering of transactions, one node takes the lead
saying "I want to add these 3 transactions to the blockchain in the
order A, C, B!". This message is sent out on the network by that
leader, in the same way as the transaction was sent by Alice.

[id=transaction-ordering]
.One node takes the lead and tells the others what order to add the transaction in. The other nodes verify the message and update their blockchain copies accordingly.
image::{imagedir}/transactions-ordered.svg[{half-width}]

As nodes see this message they update their copy of the blockchain
according to the message and passes the message on to its
neighbors. Alice's transaction was one of the transactions in the
leader's message and it is now part of the blockchain.

Why would a node want to take the lead? It's because the node that
takes the lead is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins and transaction
fees payed by the transactions it includes in the message.

But, wouldn't every node constantly take the lead to collect the
rewards? No, it is very hard to take the lead. To take the lead, a
node must solve a hard problem which takes time and electricity. It is
so hard that most nodes in the network don't even try. The nodes that
do try are called _miners_ because they mine new coins, similar to a
gold miner digging for gold. This process is described in <<ch08>>,
<<ch09>> and <<ch10>>.

[id=overview-wallets]
==== Step 4 - Wallets

Bob and Alice are users of the Bitcoin network, and they need some
computer program to interact with the network. Such a program is
called a _Bitcoin wallet_. There are several different Bitcoin wallets
for several different devices, like mobile phones and desktop
computers.

Before step 4 of the payment process, the nodes in the network have
updated their local copy of the blockchain. Now the network needs to
notify Bob that he has received one bitcoin.

[id=wallet-connection]
.Bob's wallet have asked a node to notify the wallet upon activity in mailbox 560. Alice pays to box 560, and the node has just written the transaction to the blockchain, so it notifies Bob's wallet.
image::{imagedir}/notify-bob.svg[{half-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.Wallet duties
****
A typical Bitcoin wallet will

 - [x] Hold keys
 - [x] Watch incoming bitcoins
 - [x] Send bitcoins
****

Bob's wallet is connected to some of the nodes in the Bitcoin
network. When a transaction concerning Bob is added to the blockchain,
the nodes that Bob's wallet is connected to will notify Bob's
wallet. The wallet will then display a message to Bob that he just
received one bitcoin.

As noted at the start of this section, Alice also use a wallet. Her
wallet will also be notified of her own transaction, but there's one
more very important thing that her wallet does. It holds her keys
for her. The keys are used to create digital signatures and those keys
needs to be stored securely so that only Alice can use them. Bob also
has a key, to mailbox 560, in his wallet so that he can spend the
money he just received from Alice.

=== Problems with money today

Bitcoin would not be this widespread if it didn't solve real problems
for real people. Bitcoin solves several problems with the traditional
financial system. Let us look some commonly discussed problem areas.

==== Inflation

Inflation means that the purchasing power of a currency decreases.

.Problems
****
- [ ] *Inflation*
****

.Inflation
image::{imagedir}/inflation.jpg[{half-width}]

Most currencies are subject to inflation. Some more than others. For
example the Zimbabwean dollar that during 2007-2008 inflated nearly
10^23^%, peaking at 80 billion percent per month during a few months
in 2008. That is an average daily inflation rate of nearly
100%. Prices roughly doubled every day.

Extreme cases of inflation like this are called
hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is usually initially driven by a rapid
increase in the money supply. Government sometimes increase in money
supply as a tool to extract value from its population to pay for
expenses like national debt, warfare or welfare. If this tool is
over-used, the risk of hyperinflation is apparent.

An increasing money supply will most likely lead to a depreciation of
the currency. This in turn pushes people to exchange their local
currency for goods or currencies that better holds value, which
further drives the value of the currency down. This can spiral down to
extremes like in Zimbabwe. The result is devastating for people as
they see their life savings diminish to virtually nothing.

.Some hyperinflations in modern time.
|===
|Country | Year | Worst monthly inflation [%]

|Zimbabwe | 2007-2008 | 4.19*10^16^
|Yugoslavia | 1992-1994 | 313*10^6^
|Peru | 1990 | 397
|Ukraine | 1992-1994 | 285
|Venezuela | 2016-2017 | 120
|===

Zimbabwe is one of the most extreme cases of inflation throughout
history, but still today some countries suffer from very high
inflation. One of them is Venezuela where its currency, the bolívar as
of writing faces a 480% inflation during 2016 and 2017 is forecast to
suffer from 1700% inflation.

==== Borders

Moving value across borders using fiat currency is hard, expensive and
sometimes even forbidden. If you want to send 1000 Swedish crowns
(SEK) from Sweden to a person in the Philippines, you can use a
service like Western Union for the transfer. At the time I
investigated this, 1000 SEK was worth 5305 Philippine Pesos (PHP) or
109 US dollars.

.Cost of sending 5305 PHP from Sweden to Philippines
|===
| Send from | Receive to | Received by recipient | Fees | Fees %

| Bank | Bank | 5109 PHP | 265 PHP | 4.9%
| Bank | Cash | 4810 PHP | 564 PHP | 10.5%
| Credit card | Cash | 4498 PHP | 876 PHP | 16.3%
|===

If the recipient have a bank account with the capability of receiving
international money transfer, we could get away with a 4.9% fee. A
typical remittance recipient will only be able to receive cash, which
doubles or triples the cost to 10.5% or 16.3% depending on how quick or
convenient you want it.

.Problems
****
- [ ] Inflation
- [ ] *Borders*
****

To contrast the above, moving fiat currency within the borders of a
state is usually very convenient. For example, you can hand over cash
directly to the recipient, or transfer money using some mobile app
made specifically for the currency. As long as you stay within one
country and one currency, fiat currencies usually does a pretty
good job.

==== Segregation

As noted in the previous section, not all people have access to bank
accounts. People with bank accounts and banking services like online
payments or loans are very privileged. About 38% of the world
population don't have a bank account at all, according to the World
Bank, see <<web-financial-inclusion>>. The numbers are improving but
still a vast amount of people are stuck in a cash-only environment. If
these people want to receive money from a family member abroad, they
will receive 5% less, due to higher remittance fees, than if they had
a bank account.

Without a bank account and basic bank services like online payments,
people can not expand their businesses outside of their local
community. A tailor will not be able offer services on the Internet to
increase its customer base. A person living in a rural area may have
to travel half a day just to pay a utility bill or top-up their
prepaid mobile phone.

.Problems
****
- [ ] Inflation
- [ ] Borders
- [ ] *Segregation*
****

This segregation between banked people and unbanked people is driven
by a number of factors:

* Banking services are too expensive for a large portion of the population.
* In order to use bank services you need documentation, like an ID
  card, that many people don't have.
* Banking services may be denied to people with certain political
  views or people conducting certain businesses. People may also be
  denied service due to their ethnicity.

==== Privacy issues

****
image::{imagedir}/privacy-issue-mastercard.svg[]
****

Apart from the huge problems in the previous sections there are
several other problems with traditional money. States can easily

* trace payments
* censor payments
* freeze funds
* seize funds

You might say, "I have nothing to hide, and the government need tools
to fight crime". The problem is that you do not know what your
government looks like in five years and how that government defines
crime. New laws are just an election away. After next election, your
government may pass a law that allows freezing funds of people with
your political view.

.Problems
****
- [ ] Inflation
- [ ] Borders
- [ ] Segregation
- [ ] *Privacy issues*
****

We have seen lots of examples where these abilities are misused to
disable someones ability to transact. For example, the non-profit
organization WikiLeaks was put under a blockade in 2010, see
<<web-wikileaks-blockade>>, where all donations through traditional
channels were blocked after pressure from the US government on the
major payment networks, like Visa and MasterCard. We have also seen
how Cyprus seized 47.5% [<<web-cyprus-seizure>>] of all bank deposits exceeding 100,000€ as
part of a financial rescue program in 2013.

=== The Bitcoin approach

Bitcoin offers a fundamentally different model than traditional
financial institutions. Let us explore the major differences one
by one.

==== Decentralized

Instead of a central organization controlling the currency, like the
US Federal Reserve, the control is distributed among thousands of
computers, called _Bitcoin nodes_ or just _nodes_. No single node or
group of nodes have more privileges or obligations than any other
node. This equality between nodes makes Bitcoin _decentralized_, as
opposed to _centralized_ systems like an Internet Bank service or the
Google search engine.

.Centralized and decentralized services
image::{imagedir}/centralized-decentralized.svg[{half-width}]

In a centralized system, the service is controlled by a single entity
like a bank. It implies that this single entity can decide who gets to
use the service and what the user is allowed to do. For example an
online video service may chose to provide a video only to people in a
certain geographical location.

[.inbitcoin]
.Fixed
****
- [ ] Inflation
- [ ] Borders
- [*] *Segregation*
- [*] *Privacy*
****

With at decentralized system like Bitcoin it is extremely hard to
control how and by whom the system is used. No matter where or who
they are, or whom they are sending money to, the Bitcoin system will
treat all users equally. There is no central point in the Bitcoin
system that can be exploited to censor payments, deny users service or
seize funds.

The decentralization is also a way to make it nearly impossible to
change the rules of the currency without broad consensus. If a node or
a group of nodes does not obey the rules they will be ignored by the
rest. For example, one rule is that the money supply of Bitcoin is
limited to 21,000,000 bitcoins, and that limit is nearly impossible to
change due to decentralization.

[id=limited_supply]
==== Limited supply

[.inbitcoin]
.Fixed
****
- [*] *Inflation*
- [ ] Borders
- [*] Segregation
- [*] Privacy
****

A hard promise of Bitcoin is that its money supply will not exceed 21
million bitcoins. People can be sure that if they own one bitcoin,
they know that they will _always_ own at least one 21 millionth of the
total supply of bitcoins. This feature is not found in any fiat
currency, where decisions on the supply is made every so often by a
company or a state. Bitcoin is very resistant to high inflation
because there is no way to increase the money supply at will.

The money supply of Bitcoin is actually not fixed today. It is
increasing, at a diminishing rate, according to a _predetermined_
schedule and will eventually stop increasing around year 2140.

.The supply of bitcoins over time
image::{imagedir}/money-supply.svg[{half-width}]

As of writing, the money supply is about 16.5 million bitcoins and the
current yearly increase in the money supply is about 4%, but the
increase is halving every four years.

==== Borderless

[.inbitcoin]
.Fixed
****
- [*] Inflation
- [*] *Borders*
- [*] Segregation
- [*] Privacy
****

Since Bitcoin is a system run by ordinary computers connected to the
Internet, the Bitcoin system is as global as the Internet itself. This
means that anyone with an Internet connection can send money to other
people across the world.

.Bitcoin is borderless
image::{imagedir}/borderless.svg[{big-width}]

There is no difference between sending a bitcoin to someone in the
same room or sending it to someone on another continent. The
experience is the same: Money is sent directly to the recipient, who
will see the payment nearly instantaneously and after 10-60 minutes
the recipient can be _sure_ that the money is hers. There is no way of
reversing the transfer without the recipient's consent.

=== How is Bitcoin used?

So far we have touched on a few common use cases for Bitcoin. This
section will dig deeper into those use cases and a few others. It is
hard to predict what use cases we will see in the future. Predicting
Bitcoin's future is like predicting in 1995 what the Internet will be
used for in 20 years. Let us stick to what we know now.

==== Shopping

****
image::{imagedir}/shopping-cart.png[]
****

The most obvious use case for Bitcoin is to use it for shopping. The
borderlessness and security of Bitcoin makes it ideal for online
payments for goods and services.

Instead of sending your debit card details to the merchant, and _hope_
that the merchant will withdraw as much as you agreed on. You also
_hope_ that the merchant handles your debit card details with great
care. They probably store the details in a database. Think about that;
For every debit card purchase you make, your card details will be
stored in that merchant's database. It is quite likely that _one_ the
merchants' database gets hacked and your card details are stolen. The
more merchants that stores your details, the higher the risk.

With Bitcoin, you don't have that problem, because you don't send any
sensitive information to the merchant, or anyone else. You send the
amount of money that you agreed upon, and nothing more.

==== Savings

****
image::{imagedir}/vault.png[]
****

One interesting feature of Bitcoin is that you keep your money safe by
storing a set of _private keys_. Private keys are the secret pieces of
information that you will need when you want to spend your money. You
chose how those private keys are stored. You can write them on paper,
or you can store them electronically with a mobile app to have easy
access to them. You can also memorize the private keys. The private
keys are also all that is needed to spend your money. Keep them safe.

This makes savings an attractive use case for Bitcoin. A simple way to
save is to create a private key and write it down on a piece of paper
that you store in a safe. That piece of paper is now your savings
account, that we call a wallet. You can start sending bitcoins to your
wallet. As long as your private key is kept safe, your money is
safe. There are a lot of different saving schemes you can chose from
to find the right balance between security and convenience.

==== Speculation

The world is full of people wanting to get rich quick. Bitcoin can be
very alluring to them, because of the _volatility_, tendency to
change, of the price of bitcoin. Looking at the history of the Bitcoin
price, it is very tempting to try to buy when it is low and sell when
it is high.

.Price since beginning of Bitcoin
image::{imagedir}/bitcoin-price.png[{half-width}]

In November 2013, the price climbed from about $100 (US dollars) to
over $1100 in a few weeks. This was clearly a so called _bubble_,
where people were afraid of missing out on a great rise, so they
bought in, driving the price further up, until it eventually started
dropping again. The drop to 50% of its peak value was just as quick as
its rise. Fluctuations like this is rarely driven by any specific news
or technological advancements, but from speculation.

Speculation can be fun, if you can afford to lose, but it is more like
a lottery than something to make a living off of.

==== Non-currency uses

Bitcoin is electronic cash, but this form of cash have can be used for
other things beyond money. This section covers two common uses, but
there are others including not yet invented uses.

===== Ownership

****
image::{imagedir}/transfer-ownership.svg[]
****

Bitcoin allow you to embed small pieces of data with payments. This
data can be for example a chassis number of a car. When the car leaves
the factory, the manufacturer can make a small payment to the the new
car owner and attach the chassis number. This payment will represent
the transfer of ownership for that car.

Bitcoin payments are public records but they are not tied to persons
in any way. They are tied to long strings of numbers called public
keys. The car manufacturer has made its public key publicly available
on their website, in newspapers and advertisement, to tie the public
key to the identity of the manufacturer. Anyone can then verify that
the manufacturer has transferred ownership of the car to the new
owner. The new owner can show that she owns the car by proving that
she owns the private key belonging to the public key that the
manufacturer transferred ownership to.

The new owner can sell the car to someone else and transfer ownership
by sending the very same bitcoins she got from the manufacturer to the
new owner's public key. The general public can follow the ownership of
the car from the manufacturer through every owner up to the current
owner.

===== Proof of existence

Using the same technique to store data in a payment to transfer
ownership of a car, you can prove that a document existed prior to a
certain point in time.

****
image::{imagedir}/proof-of-existence.svg[]
****

All digital documents have a "fingerprint", a cryptographic hash, that
anyone can calculate from that document. It is nearly impossible to
create a different document with the same fingerprint. This
fingerprint can be attached to a payment. It is irrelevant where the
money goes; The important thing is that the fingerprint is recorded in
the Bitcoin blockchain. You "anchor" the document in the blockchain.

Bitcoin payments are public records, so anyone can validate that the
document existed before the time of the payment by taking the
fingerprint of the document and compare it to the fingerprint stored
in the payment.

==== How is Bitcoin valued?

****
image::{imagedir}/market.svg[]
****

As you could read in section <<_speculation>>, the price of a bitcoin
can fluctuate quite dramatically. But where is this price actually
coming from? There are several Bitcoin exchanges, mostly Internet
based. They resemble stock markets, where users wanting to sell
bitcoins are matched with users wanting to buy bitcoins.

Different markets can have different market prices depending on the
supply and demand on that market. For example, in countries like
Venezuela where the government try to hinder the Bitcoin market, the
supply will be low. But the demand is high, because people want to
escape from their hyperinflating currency. These factors drives the
Bitcoin price up in that market compared to for example the US and
European markets where people can trade more freely.

==== When not to use Bitcoin

Bitcoin is nice and all, but it's not suitable for all sorts of
financial activity. At least not yet.

===== Tiny payments

Each transaction needs to pay a fee to be processed. The fee is not
related to the amount sent, but to how big the transaction is in
bytes. High-value transactions are not bigger than low-value
transactions, so the fee is about the same for both kinds of
transactions. If that fee is a significant share of the actual payment
you want to make, it is not economically feasible to pay with ordinary
Bitcoin transactions.

|===
| Amount | Fee | Fee % | Feasible

| 2 BTC | 0.003 BTC | 0.15% | Yes
| 0.002 BTC | 0.001 BTC | 50% | Probably not
| 0.001 BTC | 0.005 BTC | 500% | No
|===

There are however very promising emerging technologies, for example
the Lightning Network, that is built on top of Bitcoin that allows for
instantaneous micropayments of fractions of a cent.

===== Instant payments

Bitcoin payments takes time to confirm. A typical payment will confirm
within 20 minutes. The recipient will see the payment immediately, but
he cannot trust the payment until it is confirmed by the Bitcoin
network. This limitation can also be fixed by systems built on top of
Bitcoin, for example the Lightning Network.

The confirmation time of Bitcoin is nowhere near the confirmation
times of VISA or MasterCard, where a merchant must wait for weeks
[<<web-chargebacks>>] before
being sure that the transaction is not reversed. Merchants usually
take on some risk to avoid having their customers wait weeks before
delivering the goods or service. Bitcoin cuts this waiting period
significantly, but it is still too long for truly instant payments.

===== Savings you can not afford to lose

Bitcoin is probably the most secure money there is, but it is still in
its infancy. Things _could_ go bad with Bitcoin, for example:

* You lose your private keys, the secret data needed to spend your
  money.
* Your private keys get stolen by some bad guy.
* The government in your location may try to crack down on Bitcoin
  users by imprisonment or other means of force.
* The price of bitcoin can swing down dramatically due to rumors or
  other social activity.
* There may be software bugs that can make Bitcoin insecure.
* There may be weaknesses in the cryptography used by Bitcoin.

While all of the above are _possible_, most them are unlikely. The
list is somewhat ordered with the most likely at the top. Always weigh
the risks before putting money on the line and select your security
measures accordingly. This book will help you understand the risks and
how to secure your money.

=== Other cryptocurrencies

This book will cover Bitcoin. But there are several other so-called
cryptocurrencies, and new ones pop up all the time. Cryptocurrencies
other than Bitcoin are often referred to as _alt-coins_, alternative
coins. I will list a few popular alt-coins along with their purpose and
so-called market capitalization, market cap. The market cap is the
product of the money supply, number of coins, and the current market
price per coin. Note that the market cap will most likely have changed
a lot when you read this. I include it only to give you a glimpse of
Bitcoin's position relative to the other cryptocurrencies.

I encourage you to look up these cryptocurrencies as they all provide
interesting new features beyond Bitcoin. There are hundreds of other
alt-coins. Some alt-coins, for example the ones above, provide some
unique features that are not available in Bitcoin, and some provide
little to nothing innovative. Anyone can create an alt-coin by taking
any existing cryptocurrency software and modify it to her needs.

Let's say that Sheila wants to start an alt-coin, SheCoin. She takes
the Bitcoin software and changes the money supply to 11000000, instead
of Bitcoin's 21000000, coins and starts. When SheCoin is started she
will be very lonely, because no one else is using her alt-coin. If she
wants SheCoin to have some real value, she has got to convince other
people to start using her alt-coin. If she's not providing anything
innovative, she's going to have a hard time getting other people
on-board, since they are pretty happy with what Bitcoin is already
providing. Besides, everybody else is using Bitcoin, so why would you
use SheCoin? Think of it as starting a new internet, that you call
Internet2. People on Internet2 will not be able to use services on the
regular Internet, so why would anyone use Internet2. We call it the
network effect; People tend to go where other people are.

=== Recap

In this chapter you learned that

* Bitcoin is global, borderless money, that anyone with an internet
  connection can use.
* Bitcoin is used by many different actors, like savers, merchants,
  traders for many different purposes like payments, remittances and
  savings.
* A network of computers, the Bitcoin network, validate and keep
  records of all payments.
* A transaction goes through four steps: Send transaction, validate
  transaction, add transaction to blockchain, notify recipient wallet.
* It solves problems with inflation, borders, segregation and privacy
  by providing limited supply, decentralization and borderlessness.
* There are several alternative cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin,
  for example Ethereum, Zcash and Namecoin.
* A (crypto)currency needs to have enough users and activity to be
  useful. It's called network effect.
