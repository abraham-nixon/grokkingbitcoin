== Introduction to Bitcoin
:imagedir: {baseimagedir}/ch01

This chapter covers

* getting to know Bitcoin
* solving problems with Bitcoin
* getting the big picture

This book will hopefully teach you enough about Bitcoin so that you
can make informed decisions on how you can use Bitcoin to improve your
private life or your business. My hope is that you also will learn
enough to make up your own mind whether you trust Bitcoin or not,
hopefully the former. In order to get you off the ground, I'm going to
assume that you know roughly what the following terms mean:

* computer program
* database
* computer network
* web server

If you're unsure of any of these terms, don't worry. Either look them
up or just go ahead anyway, I think you'll manage.

=== What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. It allows for people or
computers to move value between each other without using a bank or
some other trusted third party. It resembles traditional bank notes
and coins in that way, but it is purely electronic and used over the
Internet. The Bitcoin currency is not tied to any specific _fiat
currency_ like the US dollar or the Chinese Renminbi; It has free
floating exchange rates against all fiat currencies. You can buy and
sell bitcoins for fiat currencies on one of several exchanges. No
government or company is controlling Bitcoin. Instead, thousands of
computers around the globe collectively keep the system working day
and night, seven days a week. 

Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym whose identity is unknown, published a
scientific paper on an e-mail list for cryptography related
discussions in October 2008. The title of the paper was "Bitcoin: A
Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash
System"footnote:[https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf] and it described the
vital parts of Bitcoin. Later, in January 2009, Nakamoto published the
first software program to implement the described system. Bitcoin
didn't get much attention then, apart from within a very limited set
of cryptography experts. But gradually, as the system proved itself to
be working, more people got interested in it.

Today, in 2017, several millions of people are aware of Bitcoin,
hundreds of thousands people are actively using Bitcoin and thousands
of professionals are working on developing Bitcoin related
technology. Bitcoin is primarily used for payments, savings and
speculation today. It removes friction in online payments, especially
internationally, and allows for anyone to use or participate in the
Bitcoin network without special permission from a bank or similar
institution.

The Bitcoin ecosystem consists of several actors. These are the most common
types of actors:

image::{imagedir}/actors.jpg[]

Saver:: Saves bitcoin for future use.
Shopper:: A person buying goods and services for bitcoin.
Merchant:: For example a restaurant accepting bitcoin payments.
Worker:: Someone getting her salary in bitcoin.
Exchange:: A commercial or private service people can use to exchange
their local currency to and from bitcoin.
Trader:: A short term speculator performing trading on an exchange.
Bank:: Not really a Bitcoin actor but it is nevertheless part of the
ecosystem since many actors use Banks in their Bitcoin activity.

The Bitcoin network's job is to process Bitcoin payments. The network
consists of thousands of computers that we call nodes. Some of the
nodes in the network are called Miners because they "mine" new
bitcoins with their computing power. Most nodes are non-miners. They
provide connectivity to the actors outside of the network, ordinary
users like shoppers and exchanges.

=== Problems with money today

Bitcoin would not be this widespread if it didn't solve real problems
for real people. Bitcoin solves several problems with the traditional
financial system. Let us look some commonly discussed problem areas.

==== Inflation

Inflation means that the purchasing power of a currency decreases.

.Inflation
image::{imagedir}/inflation.jpg[{half-width}]

Most currencies are subject to inflation. Some more than others. For
example the Zimbabwean dollar that during 2007-2008 inflated nearly
10^23^%, peaking at 80 billion percent per month during a few months
in 2008. That is an average daily inflation rate of nearly
100%. Prices roughly doubled every day.

Extreme cases of inflation like this are called
hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is usually initially driven by a rapid
increase in the money supply. An increasing money supply will most
likely lead to a depreciation of the currency. This in turn pushes
people to exchange their local currency for goods or currencies that
better holds value, which further drives the value of the currency
down. This can sprial down to extremes like in Zimbabwe. The result is
devastating for people as they see their life savings diminish to
virtually nothing.

The increase in money supply is sometimes used as a tool for
governments to extract value from its population to pay for expenses
like national debt, warfare or wellfare. If this tool is over-used,
the risk of hyperinflation is apparent.

Zimbabwe is one of the most extreme cases of inflation throughout
history, but still today some countries suffer from very high
inflation. One of them is Venezuela where its currency, the bolívar as
of writing faces a 480% inflation during 2016 and 2017 is forecast to
suffer from 1640% inflation.

==== Borders

Moving value across borders using fiat currency is hard, expensive and
sometimes even forbidden. If you want to send 1000 Swedish crowns
(SEK) from Sweden to a person in the Philippines, you can use a
service like Western Union for the transfer. At the time I
investigated this, 1000 SEK was worth 5305 Philippine Pesos (PHP) or
109 US dollars.

.Cost of sending 5305 PHP from Sweden to Philippines
|===
| Send from | Receive to | Received by recipient | Fees | Fees %

| Bank | Bank | 5109 PHP | 265 PHP | 4.9%

| Bank | Cash | 4810 PHP | 564 PHP | 10.5%

| Credit card | Cash | 4498 PHP | 876 PHP | 16.3%
|===

If the recipient have a bank account with the capability of receiving
international money transfer, we could get away with a 4.9% fee. A
typical remittance recipient will only be able to receive cash, which
doubles or triples the cost to 10.5% or 16.3% depending on how quick or
convenient you want it.

To contrast the above, moving fiat currency within the borders of a
state is usually very convenient. For example, you can hand over cash
directly to the recipient, or transfer money using some mobile app
made specifically for the currency. As long as you stay within one
country and one currency, fiat currencies usually does a pretty
good job.

==== Segregation

As noted in the previous section, not all people have access to bank
accounts. People with bank accounts and banking services like online
payments or loans are very privileged. About 38%
footnote:[http://datatopics.worldbank.org/financialinclusion/] of the
world population don't have a bank account at all, according to the
World Bank. The numbers are improving but still a vast amount of
people are stuck in a cash-only environment. If these people want to
receive money from a family member abroad, they will receive 5% less
than if they had a bank account.

Without a bank account and basic bank services like online payments,
people can not expand their businesses outside of their community. A
tailor will not be able offer services on the Internet to increase its
customer base. A person living in a rural area may have to travel half
a day just to pay a utility bill or top-up their prepaid mobile phone.

This segregation between banked people and unbanked people is driven
by a number of factors:

* Banking services are too expensive.
* In order to use bank services you need documentation, like an ID
  card, that many people don't have.
* Banking services may be denied to people with certain political
  views or people conducting certain businesses.

==== Privacy issues

Apart from the huge problems in the previous sections there are
several other problems with traditional money. States can easily

* trace payments
* censor payments
* freeze funds
* seize funds

You might say, "I have nothing to hide, and the government need tools
to fight crime". The problem is that you do not know what your
government looks like in five years and how that government defines
crime. New laws are just an election away. After next election, your
government may pass a law that allows freezing funds of people with
your political view.

We have seen lots of examples where these abilities are misused to
disable someones ability to transact. For example, the non-profit
organization WikiLeaks was put under a
blockade footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_of_WikiLeaks#Response_from_the_financial_industry]
in 2010, where all donations through traditional channels were blocked
after pressure from the US government on the major payment
networks. We have also seen how Cyprus
seized footnote:[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-30/cyprus-sets-levy-on-bank-of-cyprus-uninsured-depositors-at-47-5-]
47.5% of all bank deposits exceeding 100,000€ as part of a financial
rescue program in 2013.

=== The Bitcoin approach

Bitcoin offers a fundamentally different model than traditional
financial institutions. Let us explore the major differences one
by one.

==== Decentralized

Instead of a central organization controlling the currency, like the
US Federal Reserve, the control is distributed among thousands of
computers, called _Bitcoin nodes_ or just _nodes_. No single node or
group of nodes have more privileges or obligations than any other
node. This equality between nodes makes Bitcoin _decentralized_, as
opposed to _centralized_ systems like an Internet Bank service or the
Google search engine.

.Centralized and decentralized services
image::{imagedir}/centralized_decentralized.jpg[{half-width}]

In a centralized system, the service is controlled by a single entity
like a bank. It implies that this single entity can decide who gets to
use the service and what the user is allowed to do. For example a
national TV network may chose to provide movie clips online only to
people in a certain geographical location.

With at decentralized system like Bitcoin it is extremely hard to
control how and by whom the system is used. No matter where or who
they are, or whom they are sending money to, the Bitcoin system will
treat all users equally. There is no central point in the Bitcoin
system that can be exploited to censor payments, deny users service or
seize funds.

The decentralization is also a way to make it nearly impossible to
change the rules of the currency without broad consensus. If a node or
a group of nodes does not obey the rules they will be ignored by the
rest. For example, one rule is that the money supply of Bitcoin is
limited to 21,000,000 bitcoins, and that limit is nearly impossible to
change due to decentralization.

[id=limited_supply]
==== Limited supply

A hard promise of Bitcoin is that its money supply will not exceed 21
million bitcoins. People can be sure that if they own one bitcoin,
they know that they will _always_ own at least one 21 millionth of the
total supply of bitcoins. This feature is not found in any fiat
currency, where decisions on the supply is made every so often by a
company or a state. Bitcoin is very resistant to high inflation
because there is no way to increase the money supply at will.

The money supply of Bitcoin is actually not fixed today. It is
increasing, at a diminishing rate, according to a _predetermined_
schedule and will eventually stop increasing around year 2140.

.The supply of bitcoins over time
image::{imagedir}/money_supply.jpg[{half-width}]

As of writing, the money supply is about 16 million bitcoins and the
current yearly increase in the money supply is about 4%, but the
increase is decreasing towards zero over time.

==== Borderless

Since Bitcoin is a system run by ordinary computers connected to the
Internet, the Bitcoin system is as global as the Internet itself. This
means that anyone with an Internet connection can send money to other
people across the world.

.Bitcoin is borderless
image::{imagedir}/borderless.jpg[{half-width}]

There is no difference between sending a bitcoin to someone in the
same room or sending it to someone on another continent. The
experience is the same: Money is sent directly to the recipient, who
will see the payment nearly instantaneously and after about 10 minutes
the recipient can be _sure_ that the money is hers. There is no way of
reversing the transfer without the recipient's consent.

=== How is Bitcoin used?

So far we have touched on a few common use cases for Bitcoin. This
section will dig deeper into those use cases and a few others. It is
hard to predict what use cases we will see in the future. Predicting
Bitcoin's future is like predicting in 1995 what the Internet will be
used for in 20 years. Let us stick to what we know now.

==== Savings

One interesting feature of Bitcoin is that your money is kept safe by
storing a set of _private keys_. Private keys are the secret pieces of
information that you will need when you want to spend your money. You
chose how those private keys are stored. You can write them on paper,
or you can store them electronically with a mobile app to have easy
access to them. You can also memorize the private keys. The private
keys are also all that is needed to spend your money. Keep them safe.

This makes Bitcoin ideal for saving. A simple way to save is to create
a private key and write it down on a piece of paper that you store in
a safe. That piece of paper is now your wallet. You can start sending
bitcoins to your wallet. As long as your private key is kept safe,
your money is safe. There are a lot of different saving schemes you
can chose from to find the right balance between security and
convenience.

==== Speculation

The world is full of people wanting to get rich quick. Bitcoin can be
very alluring to them, because of the _volatility_, tendency to
change, of the price of bitcoin. Looking at the history of the Bitcoin
price, it is very tempting to try to buy when it is low and sell when
it is high.

.Price since beginning of Bitcoin
image::{imagedir}/price_graph.jpg[{half-width}]

In November 2013, the price climbed from about $100 (US dollars) to
over $1100 in a few weeks. This was clearly a so called _bubble_,
where people were afraid of missing out on a great rise, so they
bought in, driving the price further up, until it eventually started
dropping again. The drop to 50% of its peak value was just as quick as
its rise. Fluctuations like this is rarely driven by any specific news
or technological advancements, but from speculation.

Speculation can be fun but it is more like a lottery than something to
make a living off of.

==== Non-currency uses

Bitcoin is electronic cash, but this form of cash have properties that
can be used for other things beyond money. This section covers two
common uses, but there are others including not yet invented uses.

===== Ownership

Bitcoin allow you to embed small pieces of data with payments. This
data can be for example a chassis number of a car. When the car leaves
the factory, the manufacturer can make a small payment to the the new
car owner and attach the chassis number. This payment will represent
the transfer of ownership for that car.

Bitcoin payments are public records but they are not tied to persons
in any way. They are tied to long strings of numbers called Bitcoin
addresses. The car manufacturer has made its Bitcoin address publicly
available on their website, in newspapers and advertisement, to tie
the bitcoin address to the identity of the manufacturer. Anyone can
then verify that the manufacturer has transferred ownership of the car
to the new owner. The new owner can show that she owns the car by
proving that she owns the Bitcoin address that the manufacturer
transferred ownership to.

The new owner can sell the car to someone else and transfer ownership
by sending the very same money she got from the manufacturer to the
new owner's Bitcoin address. The general public can follow the
ownership of the car from the manufacturer through every owner up to
the current owner.

===== Proof of existence

Using the same technique to store data in a payment to transfer
ownership of a car, you can prove that a document existed prior to a
certain point in time.

All digital documents have a fingerprint, that anyone can calculate
from that document. It is nearly impossible to create a different
document with the same fingerprint. This fingerprint can be attached
to a payment. It is irrelevant where the money goes; The important
thing is that the fingerprint is recorded in the Bitcoin system.

Bitcoin payments are public records, so anyone can validate that the
document existed before the time of the payment by taking the
fingerprint of the document and compare it to the fingerprint stored
in the payment.

==== How is Bitcoin valued?

As you could read in section <<speculation>>, the price of a bitcoin
can fluctuate quite dramatically. But where is this price actually
coming from? There are several Bitcoin exchanges, mostly internet
based. They resemble stock markets, where users wanting to sell
bitcoins are matched with users wanting to buy bitcoins. Exchanges
usually publish their _order books_, which can look something like
this:

.Order book
image::{imagedir}/order_book.jpg[{half-width}]

It gives a user an overview of how much bitcoin is available at a
certain price and how much bitcoin can be sold at a certain price. The
price of bitcoin on an exchange is usually the price of the last trade
made on that exchange. You can also get an idea of the price by
looking where the two lines in the order book meet on the price axis.

==== When not to use Bitcoin

Bitcoin is nice and all, but it's not suitable for all sorts of
financial activity. At least not yet.

===== Tiny payments

Each transaction needs to pay a fee to be processed, and if that fee
is a significant share of the actual payment you want to make, it is
not economically feasible to pay with ordinary Bitcoin
transactions. There are however very promising emerging technology,
called the Lightning Network, that is built on top of Bitcoin that
allows for instantaneous micropayments of fractions of a cent.

===== Instant payments

Bitcoin payments takes time to confirm. A typical payment will confirm
within 20 minutes. The recipient will see the payment immediately, but
he cannot trust the payment until it is confirmed by the Bitcoin
network. This limitation will also be fixed by systems built on top of
Bitcoin, for example the Lightning Network.

The confirmation time of Bitcoin is nowhere near the confirmation
times of VISA or MasterCard, where a merchant must wait for
weeks footnote:[https://www.dalpay.com/en/support/chargebacks.html]
before being almost sure that the transaction is not reversed.

===== Savings you can not afford to lose

Bitcoin is probably the most secure money there is, but it is still in
its infancy. Things _could_ go bad with Bitcoin, for example:

* You lose your private keys, the secret data needed to spend your
  money.
* Your private keys get stolen, or rather, copied by some bad guy.
* The government in your location may try to crack down on bitcoin
  users by imprisonment or other means of force.
* The price of bitcoin can swing down dramatically due to rumors or
  other social activity.
* There may be software errors that can make Bitcoin insecure.
* There may be weaknesses in the cryptography used by Bitcoin.

While all of the above are _possible_, most them are unlikely. The
list is somewhat ordered with the most likely at the top. Always weigh
the risks before putting money on the line and select your security
measures accordingly. This book will help you understand the risks and
how to secure your money.

=== The big picture

You will encounter several concepts in Bitcoin as you read this
book. Each chapter focus on a commonly performed task, and we will
explore the concepts behind that task as we stumble upon them.

The Bitcoin network validates and confirms payments. The Bitcoin
network is a network of computers running Bitcoin software. A payment
starts with a user, Alice in our example, asking the Bitcoin network to
move money from her to Bob.

.Bitcoin payment overview
image::{imagedir}/mental_model.jpg[{full-width}]

Let us follow Alice's payment from Alice to Bob:

. Alice asks the Bitcoin network to move 1 bitcoin from her to Bob.
. The computers in the network check that Alice actually has the
money to send and that she is authorized to send them.
. Each computer update its own copy of the Bitcoin ledger with the
new payment information.
. The network notifies Bob that he has received 1 bitcoin.

Note how Alice does not really _send_ 1 bitcoin to Bob, but asks the
Bitcoin network to subtract 1 bitcoin from Alice's balance, and to add
1 bitcoin to Bob's balance in the Bitcoin ledger. The Bitcoin ledger
is a database that each computer in the Bitcoin network has a
copy of.

We will go through these steps a bit closer in the next four sections,
one step per section.

[id=overview-transactions]
==== Step 1 - Transactions

Step 1 of the process is when Alice asks the network to move 1 bitcoin
to Bob. She asks by sending a Bitcoin _transaction_ to the Bitcoin
network. The transaction contains instructions on how to move the
money in the ledger and a proof that Alice actually is authorized to
move the money. Let us start with a picture that visualizes the
transaction.

[id=bitcoin_payment]
.A Bitcoin transaction
image::{imagedir}/transaction_mailbox.jpg[{half-width}]

The Bitcoin _transaction_, can be regarded as transferring
money from one locked mailbox to another. Yes, we are talking about
_physical_ mailboxes for this analogy. Only the owner of the key to a
mailbox will be able to pull money out of that mailbox, but anyone is
able to put money into the mailbox through the slot. Alice, the owner
of the key to mailbox 321 in the picture, will withdraw 1 BTC from
mailbox 321 and deposit the bitcoin into mailbox 560, Bob's
mailbox. She is the only one who can do that because only she has the
key to mailbox 321. In digital form, this transaction is a piece of
data specifying

* the mailbox to withdraw from (321)
* the amount to withdraw (1 BTC)
* what mailbox to move the money to (560).
* a _digital signature_

The digital signature corresponds to Alice _opening mailbox 321 with
her key_. Only she can open mailbox 321. Likewise, only she can create
the digital signature.

Alice sends this transaction to one or more _Bitcoin nodes_, computers
in the Bitcoin network. This is the moment where Alice asks the
network to move money in step 1.

==== Step 2 - The Bitcoin network

Alice have already sent a transaction to a number of Bitcoin nodes. In
step 2 of the process, each node checks that the transaction is
valid. They do that by consulting their copy of the ledger, to check if

* mailbox 321 contains the money she wants to spend.
* she has successfully unlocked the mailbox.

Each node doing these checks are part of the Bitcoin network. Nodes
connect to some other nodes and together they form a network, the
Bitcoin network.

[id=overview-bitcoin-network]
.The Bitcoin network
image::{imagedir}/bitcoin_network.jpg[{half-width}]

If all checks pass, a node will forward the transaction to the nodes
it is connected to in the Bitcoin network. Alice's transaction would
shortly have traveled the whole network while being validated by each
node along the way.

==== Step 3 - The blockchain

In step 3 each node updates its local copy of the ledger with the
information in Alice's transaction. The ledger is called _the
blockchain_ for reasons explained later. The blockchain contains
historic information about previous payments, and new payments are
added to it every now and then. The computers in the Bitcoin network
constantly try to keep this ledger up to date with each other.

It is not as straight forward as it may seem to update the blockchain
with Alice's transaction. Alice's transaction is not the only
transaction that goes on. There are possibly thousands of transactions
in-flight at the same time in the Bitcoin network. If all nodes would
just update their copy of the blockchain as they receive transactions
the copies would not remain copies for long. The transactions may come
in different order on different nodes:

[id=transaction-ordering]
.Transactions unordered
image::{imagedir}/transaction_ordering.jpg[{half-width}]

To coordinate the ordering of transactions, one node takes the lead
saying "I want to add these 3 transactions to the blockchain in the
order A, C, B!". This message is sent out on the network by that
leader, just as Alice's transaction was by Alice.

[id=transaction-ordering]
.Transactions ordered
image::{imagedir}/transactions_ordered.jpg[{half-width}]

As nodes see this message they update their copy of the blockchain
according to the message and passes the message on to its
neighbors. Alice's transaction was one of the transactions in the
leader's message and it is now part of the blockchain. It's time to
notify Bob!

[id=overview-wallets]
==== Step 4 - Wallets

Bob and Alice are users of the Bitcoin network, and they need some
computer program to interact with the network. Such a program is
called a _Bitcoin wallet_. There are several different Bitcoin wallets
for several different devices, like mobile phones and desktop
computers.

Before step 4 of the payment process, the nodes in the network have
updated their local copy of the blockchain. Now the network needs to
notify Bob that he has received one bitcoin.

[id=wallet-connection]
.Notifying Bob
image::{imagedir}/notifying_bob.jpg[{half-width}]

Bob's wallet is connected to some of the nodes in the Bitcoin network, just
like a node is connected to some nodes. When a transaction concerning
Bob is added to the blockchain, the nodes that Bob's wallet is
connected to will notify Bob's wallet. The wallet will then display a
message to Bob that he just received one bitcoin.

As noted at the start of this section, Alice also use a wallet. Her
wallet will also be notified of her own transaction, but there's one
more very important thing that her wallet does. It holds her keys
for her. The keys, as discussed in section <<overview-transaction>>,
are used to create digital signatures and those keys need to be stored
securely so that only Alice can use them. Bob also has a key to
mailbox 560 in his wallet so that he can spend the money he just
received from Alice.
