Bitcoin is changing the world.

The world has seen several major improvements to human life. Among
them are vaccine, electricity, radio, automobiles, and the
Internet. Some of these technologies start out as rich man's games,
but eventually they will trickle down to the general public and bring
huge benefits to Earths population. Bitcoin is right there among
them. Soon.

This is what makes me super-excited about Bitcoin. Luckily, I'm
fortunate enough to live in a pretty functional society. I have never
had problems conducting in financial transactions without someone
knocking on my door. I've never felt that I need to spend my money
_immediately_, because otherwise hyperinflation will eat my lunch. But
that also makes it harder for me to grok why Bitcoin is
important. Bitcoin is mostly theoretical to me, but when I hear
reports from less fortunate people living under oppressive or
incompetent regimes about how Bitcoin makes their lives better, it
gets very real. Bitcoin will give people an opportunity to opt-out of
the system they were previously held hostage in.

Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for a person or a group that wants to
remain unknown, published a scientific paper on a
cryptography-oriented e-mail list in October 2008. The title of the
paper was "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", see
<<web-bitcoin-paper>>. Nakamoto's paper described the vital parts of
Bitcoin, the first digital money system where there's no central
authority to issue money or process transactions. Later, in January
2009, Nakamoto published the first software program to implement the
described system. Bitcoin didn’t get much attention then, apart from
within a very limited set of cryptography experts. Gradually, as the
system proved itself to be working, more people got interested
in it. But the resistance against Bitcoin was and is still far bigger
and louder than the adopters, as is the case with all ground-breaking
new technology. As of 2018, hundreds of millions of people are aware
of Bitcoin and millions of people are using Bitcoin.

When I started exploring Bitcoin in 2013, it took me a lot of time to
get a decent understanding of the technology. That's not because I'm
remarkably stupid, it's because Bitcoin is a complex system. It's not
just a fancy database, it's a mishmash of economy, mathematics,
technology, and anthropology.

I started a technical blog about Bitcoin in 2015, and I guess Manning
liked my content, because they emailed me and asked if I was
interested in writing a book about "blockchain". Since my passion is
with Bitcoin, not just the blockchain (which is a tiny part of
Bitcoin), I replied and thanked them for their interest in me and said
that I'd be interested in writing a book about Bitcoin. I've struggled
a few years trying to find a good place in the Bitcoin community, and
this opportunity seemed like a great fit. The project started and it
turned out to be far harder and far more time consuming than I
thought.

The book started out as a typical technical description of Bitcoin,
but it was hard to teach one topic without the full context of
Bitcoin. The cognitive load in the beginning of the book would simply
be too overwhelming. It became clear that I needed to do something
else. I discussed it with my wife and we came up with the idea of
conceptually building Bitcoin from the ground up. We start with a
really simple spreadsheet system that anyone can understand and we let
that system evolve into Bitcoin. Each chapter points out a problem
with the current system and we fix it by adding the technology covered
by that chapter.

Grokking Bitcoin will be released under the Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA
4.0) license no later than three months from publication. Releasing
under an open source license was a requirement I had for writing the
book. This is my way of giving back to the Bitcoin community that has
given me so much over the years. However, there are other, less
philanthropic reasons: Open sourcing the will probably benefit sales
because the book will get more exposure and people can browse through
the content before buying.

I hope you enjoy reading Grokking Bitcoin as much as I suffered
writing it.

== Acknowledgments

I have a lot of people to thank for making this book possible.

First, I'd like to thank my wife, Linnéa, for all valuable discussions
and your consistent encouragement. You are absolutely fantastic.

Christina Taylor at Manning, my dear development editor. Thank you for
keeping me busy and winging this project. Work work work. Thank you
also to Bert Bates for your very valuable input on the pedagogy.

I'd like to also thank everyone else on Manning, who contributed with
their professionalism. Ozren Harlovic, Rebecca Rinehart, Candace
Gillhoolley, Ana Romac, Michael Stephens, Erin Twohey, Christopher
Kaufmann, Matko Hrvatin, Greg Wild. Thanks.

I'd also like to thank Jonathan Jogenfors and Pontus Lindblom for
reviewing some chapters covering their respective fields of expertise.
 
A lot of people on various forums on the Internet has been very
helpful during my research. The ones that stand out the most are David
A. Harding, Pieter Wuille and Mark "Murch" Erhardt. Thank you for all
Twitter conversations and great answers on Bitcoin Stack Exchange,
<<web-stackexchange>>.

I got help from Andreas M. Antonopoulos when negotiating the open
source terms for this book. Your encouragement during that process was
gold. Thank you! And also, thank you for the "vegetarian restaurant"
analogy used in <<ch11>>. thank you also for all your amazing talks,
you are major source of inspiration for me.

I have written this book using asciidoctor, which is a text markup
language. Thank you Dan Allen for your hard work on asciidoctor. It's
fantastic.

The book has gone through three review rounds, with several reviewers
in each round. Those reviews have been extremely useful in vetting our
ideas and finding gaps in the learning path: Jan Goyvaerts, Max
Humber, Iryna Romanenko, Jean-François Morin, Al Krinker, Joel
Kotarski, Markus Beckmann, Christopher Bailey, Viton Vitanis, Paolo
Freuli, Tomo Helman, Marcello Seri, Maciej Drozdzowski, Cicero
Zandona, Barnaby Norman, Frances Buontempo, Glenn Swonk, and Sergio
Fernandez Gonzalez.

Thank you also to all MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) readers who
contributed their thoughts, corrections, and questions on the Manning
Forum.

If I left someone out, I'm terribly sorry, thank you too.

== About this book

=== Who should read this book

This book is intended for technically interested people wanting to
understand Bitcoin on a deep technical level. The book does not
require any programming skills, but a basic understanding of some
technical concepts are beneficial, for example databases, computer
networks, computer programs, and web servers.

The primary goal of the book is that *you will be able to decide for
yourself whether you trust Bitcoin or not*. That primary goal is hard
to achieve, because you need to learn most concepts in Bitcoin, such
as digital signatures, proof-of-work, and peer-to-peer networks, on a
pretty deep level. Some secondary goals falls out naturally from the
primary goal:

* Install and use a Bitcoin wallet on your phone, and understand what
  you're doing.
* Engage in technical Bitcoin discussions.
* Make informed decisions on how to store your private keys depending
  on Bitcoin amounts stored and required level of security and
  convenience.
* Run a full Bitcoin node to engage in financial transactions without
  trusting a third party.

=== How this book is organized

This book consists of 11 chapters and three appendices.

1. An overview of Bitcoin. You'll learn what Bitcoin is, why it
matters and roughly how it operates.
2. Cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures. These are the
fundamental building blocks needed for the rest of this book. We also
lay the groundwork for a fictive money system, cookie tokens, that
we'll build upon during chapters 2 through 8.
3. Bitcoin addresses. What is a Bitcoin address, why are they needed
and how are they created and used?
4. Wallets. We go through how a Bitcoin wallet keeps track of your
secret keys and how multiple secret keys can be generated from a
single huge random number, called a seed. Backups are also discussed
in detail.
5. Transactions. We explore the anatomy of a Bitcoin transaction and
how they are digitally signed and processed.
6. The blockchain. Transactions are stored in a database that we call
the blockchain. We walk you through how the blockchain is structured
and how it enables the use of so-called lightweight wallets.
7. Proof of work. Proof of work is used to select who gets to add new
transactions to the blockchain. This process, called mining, is what
keeps your bitcoins secure in the blockchain.
8. The Bitcoin network. Bitcoin has no central point of control, we
will see how that's possible with a peer to peer network. We also
explain how to take active part in the Bitcoin network by running your
own _node_.
9. Transactions revisited. We circle back to transactions and discover
some bells and whistles that are important for various applications.
10. Segregated witness. In 2017, Bitcoin was upgraded with a major
improvement to transaction reliability and blockchain capacity. This
chapter gives you all the details.
11. Bitcoin upgrades. We will go through _soft forks_ and _hard forks_
and how soft forks together with a careful deployment plan can be used
to safely upgrade Bitcoin.

I suggest that you read chapters 2-8, where we will build the cookie
token system from the ground up, sequentially. Each chapter will add a
technology to the cookie token system to solve a specific problem, and
in chapter 8 we will have built Bitcoin. Chapters 9, 10 and 11 can
then be read out-of-order, or some of those chapters may be skipped. I
do however recommend to read chapter 11 carefully, because I think it
is the essence of Bitcoin. If you get chapter 11, you're grokking
Bitcoin.

.The periscope

We will reuse some overview figures from <<ch01>> every now and then
throughout the book to help you with orientation, both in chapter
intros and embedded inside the chapters. It's easy to lose track of
the big picture and what the goal of the current topic is. Look for
the periscope picture and section headers like "Where were we?".

Each chapter, except <<ch01>>, contains exercises. They are there for
you to assess your skills. Each batch of exercises is divided into an
easier section called "Warm up", used for shorter fact checks, and a
tougher section, "Dig in", that requires more thinking. The difficulty
of some exercises, especially in the "Dig in" sections, can be
dreadful, so please don't feel put off if you get stuck on some of
them. If you get stuck, I suggest that you consult <<app2>> for
answers.

=== About the Code

There's not much code in this book. None actually. But there are some
linux commands in <<ch08>> and <<app1>>. A command is prefixed by a
dollar sign and a space, `$ `, as follows:

----
$ cd ~/.bitcoin
----

When a command is too long to fit on a single line we break the line
with a backslash `\` where the line is broken and indent the next line
by 4 characters as follows:

[.fullwidth]
----
$ ./bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction \
    30bca6feaf58b811c1c36a65c287f4bd393770c23a4cc63c0be00f28f62ef170 1
----

Backslash can be used to write commands across multiple lines in most
linux command line interpreters, so you can copy and paste line
breaked commands into your terminal. The output from commands are not
line-breaked with backslash, they are just wrapped as needed.

Throughout the book we will write data in `fixed-width` font, for
example `7af24c99`. We usually don't explicitly write out what
encoding (decimal numbers, hexadecimal strings, base64 strings, base58
strings and so forth) we use, because it's often obvious from the
context.

=== Author online


=== Other author resources

If you have specific questions about Bitcoin that you didn't find the
answer to in this book, I really recommend Bitcoin Stack Exchange,
<<web-stackexchange>>, which is a platform for questions and answers
where good answers get up-voted by readers.

I can also recommend the Bitcoin Developer Reference, <<web-dev-ref>>,
for more comprehensive documentation of Bitcoin.

However, the Bitcoin Core source code, available on
<<web-bitcoin-source>>, is the most accurate source of information. It
is the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, and reading
that source code is sometimes the only way to find answers to your
questions.

If you want to search the contents of this book online, I recommend
searching through the source code available at
<<web-book-source>>. However, this will not be available immediately
when the book is released, but at latest three months from release.
