Let's make it censorship resistant. Two more coworkers, Tom and Lin,
wants to Join and compete for the block rewards. They get also write
access to the shared folder, but they can only remove files they
created themselves. They also publish their public keys on a bulletin
board and the company intranet.

Who publishes next block? Chance! They each draw a number between 1
and 30. If they draw a 1-10 they get to publish the next block. What
if two wins? No worries, both publishes and the next block will break
the tie.

Lin can cheat in this competition. She will just pretend to have won
the lottery every block and always publish the next block. This will
give her a disproportionate part of the block rewards. It's hard to
prove that she cheats until she's cheated for a long time. She could
"get lucky" 10 times in a row.
