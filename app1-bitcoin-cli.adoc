== Using `bitcoin-cli`

This appendix continues where <<run-your-own-full-node>> ended. We
will use the full node that we installed then to setup a Bitcoin
wallet, receive and send bitcoins, and learn how to explore the
Bitcoin blockchain using `bitcoin-cli`, the command line tool of
Bitcoin Core.

Note that this appendix will not go into great depth on what
`bitcoin-cli` is capable of. This should only be regarded as a source
of inspiration and provide you with the basics to get started. You are
encouraged to explore your node further yourself.

=== Communicating with `bitcoind`

When `bitcoind` starts, it also starts a web server that listens on
TCP port `8332` by default. When you use `bitcoin-cli`, it will
connect to the web server and send your command to the web server over
`http` and display relevant parts of the response to you.

For example, suppose that you want to know the block id of the genesis
block (the block at height 0) and issue the following command:

----
$ ./bitcoin-cli getblockhash 0
----

`bitcoin-cli` creates a http `POST` request with body:

----
{"method":"getblockhash","params":[0],"id":1}
----

and sends it to the web server that `bitcoind` runs. The `method`
property of the request body is the command that you want to execute
and the argument `0` is passed to the web server as an array with a
single element.

The web server processes the http request by looking up the block hash
in the blockchain and replies with an http response with a body

----
{"result":"000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f","error":null,"id":"1"}
----

`bitcoin-cli` then displayed the value of the "result" property on
your terminal.

----
000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
----

This body of the http request follows a standard called JSON-RPC which
describes how a client can call functions on a remote process using
JSON, JavaScript Object Notation.

==== Using curl

Since the communication with `bitcoind` happens through `http`, any
program capable of sending `http POST` requests, such as the command
line tool `curl`, can be used to communicate with `bitcoind`. However,
to use other tools than `bitcoin-cli`, you need to setup a username
and password to use as authentication to the web server.

[.gbinfo]
.More parameters
****
There are a lot of options in Bitcoin Core. Run `./bitcoind --help` to
get a complete list.
****

Stop the node with `./bitcoin-cli stop`. Open, or create if
non-existent, Bitcoin Core's configuration file
`~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` and add the lines

----
rpcuser=<a username that you select>
rpcpassword=<a password that you select>
----

When you have modified and saved the `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` file,
start your node again using `./bitcoind -daemon`.

Now you can try to do `getblockhash` using `curl` (the backslash `\`
character means that the command continues on the next line):

[.fullwidth]
----
curl --user kalle --data-binary \
    '{"method":"getblockhash","params":[0],"id":1}' \
    -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/
Enter host password for user 'kalle':
{"result":"000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f","error":null,"id":1}
----

Remember to change the username from `kalle` to the username you
configured in `bitcoin.conf`.

This command will prompt you for the password. Enter the password and
hit return. The reply from the web server will be the same as when you
used `bitcoin-cli` but you will need to scan through the response body
yourself to spot the result, which is the hash of block 0.

=== Graphical user interface

Bitcoin Core comes with a graphical user interface (GUI).

This appendix mainly deals with the command-line interface
`bitcoin-cli` for controlling and querying your running
`bitcoind`. But if you want to use Bitcoin Core as a Bitcoin wallet
(and not just as a full node), it can be really useful to familiarize
yourself with the GUI version. The GUI version of Bitcoin Core allows
you to perform most common tasks that's expected from a Bitcoin wallet,
but to access the full set of features of Bitcoin Core you'll need to
use `bitcoin-cli`.

To use the GUI version of Bitcoin Core, you need to stop the current
node and start the GUI version, called `bitcoin-qt`:

.Why "-qt"?
[.gbinfo]
****
The Bitcoin Core GUI is built using a GUI programming library called
QT, hence the name, `bitcoin-qt`.
****
----
$ ./bitcoin-cli stop
Bitcoin server stopping
$ ./bitcoin-qt &
----

If `bitcoind` didn't have time to finish shutdown before you started
`bitcoin-qt`, you will get an error message from `bitcoin-qt`. If so,
click `OK` and try running `./bitcoin-qt &` again in a few seconds.

`bitcoin-qt` uses the same data directory, `~/.bitcoin/`, as
`bitcoind`, which means that `bitcoin-qt` will use the already
downloaded and verified blockchain and the same wallet as
`bitcoind`. It's just the user interface that differs.

By default, `bitcoin-qt` will not start the web server to accept
JSON-RPC requests as `bitcoind` does. So in order to use `bitcoin-cli`
with `bitcoin-qt`, please start `bitcoin-qt` as follows instead:

----
$ ./bitcoin-qt -server &
----

=== Getting to know `bitcoin-cli`

We have started Bitcoin Core in the background by running

----
 $ ./bitcoind -daemon
----

The most important command to know is the `help` command. Run it
without any arguments to get a list of all available commands:

----
$ ./bitcoin-cli help
----

You will get a pretty long list of commands grouped by subject, for
example `Blockchain`, `Mining`, and `Wallet`. Some commands are
somewhat self explanatory but if you want to know more about a
specific command you can run `help` with the command name as
argument. For example:

[.fullwidth]
----
$ ./bitcoin-cli help getblockhash
getblockhash height

Returns hash of block in best-block-chain at height provided.

Arguments:
1. height         (numeric, required) The height index

Result:
"hash"         (string) The block hash

Examples:
> bitcoin-cli getblockhash 1000
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getblockhash", "params": [1000] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/
----

There are two ways to invoke `bitcoin-cli`:

Using positional arguments:: The meanings of the arguments are based
on their relative positions. For example `./bitcoin-cli getblockhash
1000`. This is the most common way to use `bitcoin-cli`

Using named arguments:: The arguments are named on the command
line. For example `./bitcoin-cli -named getblockhash
height=1000`. This is sometimes useful when the command takes optional
arguments and you want to specify the second optional argument but not
the first. We will see examples of this later.

=== Get to work

We will create an encrypted wallet and backup the wallet. Then we will
receive some bitcoins and pass that money on to another address while
dissecting the transactions for details. All using `bitcoin-cli`.

==== Create an encrypted wallet

When `bitcoind` (or `bitcoin-qt`) starts, it will automatically create
a wallet for you, and store it in the file
`~/.bitcoin/wallet.dat`. However, this wallet is not encrypted, which
means that its private keys and its seed, used to derive key pairs as
discussed in <<ch04>>, are stored in clear on your hard drive. Let's
have a look at some data about the wallet:

----
$ ./bitcoin-cli getwalletinfo
{
  "walletname": "",
  "walletversion": 169900,
  "balance": 0.00000000,
  "unconfirmed_balance": 0.00000000,
  "immature_balance": 0.00000000,
  "txcount": 0,
  "keypoololdest": 1541941001,
  "keypoolsize": 1000,
  "keypoolsize_hd_internal": 1000,
  "paytxfee": 0.00000000,
  "hdseedid": "bb989ad4e23f7bb713eab0a272eaef3d4857f5e3",
  "hdmasterkeyid": "bb989ad4e23f7bb713eab0a272eaef3d4857f5e3",
  "private_keys_enabled": true
}
----

The output from the `getwalletinfo` command shows us various
information about the wallet currently being used. The `walletname` is
empty, which is the default name for the automatically created wallet.

The `balance` is how much confirmed bitcoins you have (including
unconfirmed outgoing transactions), while the `unconfirmed_balance` is
the sum of incoming unconfirmed payments. The `immature_balance` is
only relevant for miners, and denotes the amount of newly created
bitcoins, that can't be spent until after 100 blocks passed.

Please refer to the help section on `getwalletinfo` for more details
about the output.

In order to create an encrypted wallet you need to create a _new_
wallet using the command `encryptwallet`:

[.fullwidth]
----
$ ./bitcoin-cli -stdin encryptwallet
secretpassword<ENTER>
<CTRL-D>
wallet encrypted; Bitcoin server stopping, restart to run with encrypted wallet. The keypool has been flushed and a new HD seed was generated (if you are using HD). You need to make a new backup.
----

The above command command creates a new encrypted wallet. The `-stdin`
option is used to read the password argument from standard input,
which in this case means that you type the password in your terminal
window after the command is started. End your input by hitting Enter
and Ctrl-D. The reason of using `-stdin` is that we don't want the
password to be written in the command itself because most shell
interpreters, such as bash, keeps a history of commands in a file. The
`-stdin` option ensures that the password does not end up in any such
history files.

It's important to create a new encrypted wallet instead of just
encrypting the already existing wallet. This is because the old wallet
may already have been compromised on your hard drive. As noted by the
output, `bitcoind` has stopped. Bitcoin Core can't currently switch to
a new wallet file while running. Let's start `bitcoind` again and look
at the wallet:

----
$ ./bitcoind -daemon
Bitcoin server starting
$ ./bitcoin-cli getwalletinfo
{
  "walletname": "",
  "walletversion": 169900,
  "balance": 0.00000000,
  "unconfirmed_balance": 0.00000000,
  "immature_balance": 0.00000000,
  "txcount": 0,
  "keypoololdest": 1541941063,
  "keypoolsize": 1000,
  "keypoolsize_hd_internal": 1000,
  "unlocked_until": 0,
  "paytxfee": 0.00000000,
  "hdseedid": "590ec0fa4cec43d9179e5b6f7b2cdefaa35ed282",
  "hdmasterkeyid": "590ec0fa4cec43d9179e5b6f7b2cdefaa35ed282",
  "private_keys_enabled": true
}
----

Your old unencrypted `wallet.dat` has been overwritten by the new
encrypted `wallet.dat`. However, for safety, your old seed is kept in
the new encrypted wallet, in case you had actual funds in the old
wallet, or if you accidentally receive funds to that old wallet in the
future. The `unlocked_until` value of `0` means that the private parts
of your wallet is locked by the password you entered when you
encrypted the wallet. From now on, wou need to unlock the private
parts of your wallet in order to access them. We will do that when we
send bitcoin further down this chapter.

==== Backup the wallet

We have created an encrypted wallet, and before we start using it we
need to backup the wallet. In <<ch04>> we talked about mnemonic
sentences, as defined in BIP39, that made backups of a hierarchical
deterministic wallet seed really simple. However, this feature is
_not_ implemented in Bitcoin Core. There are a few reasons for this,
the main reasons are that the mnemonic sentence lacks information
about:

* version of seed format

* "birthday", which is when the seed was created. Without a birthday
  you have to scan the whole blockchain to find your old
  transactions. With a birthday you'd only have to scan the blockchain
  from the birthday and forward.

* the derivation paths to use for restoration. This is somewhat
  remedied by using standard derivation paths, but not all wallets
  implement the standard.

* Other arbitrary metadata, such as labels on addresses.

So in order to backup your Bitcoin Core wallet, you need to make a
copy of the `wallet.dat` file. Be careful not to copy the file using
your operating system's copy facilities while `bitcoind` or
`bitcoin-qt` is running. If you do that, your backup might be in an
inconsistent state because `bitcoind` might be writing data to it
while you copy. To make sure you get a consistent copy of the file
while Bitcoin Core is running, please run the command

----
$ ./bitcoin-cli backupwallet ~/walletbackup.dat
----

This will instruct `bitcoind` to save a copy of the wallet file to
`walletbackup.dat` in your home directory, but you can change the name
and path of the file to anything you like. The backup file will be an
exact copy of the original `wallet.dat` file. Move the
`walletbackup.dat` file to a safe place, for example a USB memory in
bank deposit box, or on a computer at your brother's apartment.

==== Receive money

You have created an encrypted, backed up wallet. Great! Let's put some
bitcoins into your wallet. To do that you need a Bitcoin address to
receive the bitcoins to, so let's get one:

----
$ ./bitcoin-cli -named getnewaddress address_type=bech32
bc1q2r9mql4mkz3z7yfxvef76yxjd637r429620j75
----

The above command creates a bech32 p2wpkh address for you. If you
prefer another type of address, you can change `bech32` to `legacy` to
get a p2pkh address or `p2sh-segwit` to get a p2wpkh nested in p2sh
address. Please head back to <<recap-of-payment-types>> to refresh
your memory on the different payment and address types.

Now, let's send bitcoin to that address. Please be careful to not send
money to the address printed in this book, though the author would
happily accept it, but to an address that you generate yourself with
your own full node wallet.

This opens the question on how to actually get bitcoins to send to
your wallet. There are several ways to get bitcoin:

[.gbinfo]
.On the web
****
Please visit <<web-getting-started>> to find out more about how to get
bitcoins where you live.
****

* Buy bitcoins on an exchange
* Ask a friend who has bitcoins if she can give or sell you some
* Earn bitcoins as payment for your labor
* Mine bitcoins

I will leave it up to you how you get hold of bitcoins and just assume
that you somehow will get bitcoins into the address you created above.

When you have made the payment to your new address, please check your
wallet:

----
$ ./bitcoin-cli getunconfirmedbalance
0.00500000
----

This shows that you have a pending incoming payment of 5 mBTC (0.005
BTC). We now have to wait until it's confirmed in the
blockchain. Meanwhile, we can dig into the transaction by running the
`listtransactions` command:

[.fullwidth]
----
$ ./bitcoin-cli listtransactions
[
  {
    "address": "bc1q2r9mql4mkz3z7yfxvef76yxjd637r429620j75",
    "category": "receive",
    "amount": 0.00500000,
    "label": "",

    "trusted": false,

    "timereceived": 1541941483,
    "bip125-replaceable": "yes"
  }
]
----

We can see that the transaction has 0 confirmations and that it pays
us 0.005 BTC. We also see that the txid of this transaction is
`ebfd0d14c2ea74ce408d01d5ea79636b8dee88fe06625f5d4842d2a0ba45c195`.

Let's take a closer look at the transaction using the command
`getrawtransaction`:

}
----

This command prints the whole transaction in a human-readable (well at
least developer-readable) form. Let's start from the top and go
through the most relevant parts of this transaction. The `txid` is the
transaction id of this transaction. The `hash` is the double SHA256
hash of the whole transaction, including the witness. For non-segwit
transactions, `hash` is equal to `txid`.

The `size` of the transaction is 223 bytes, and `vsize` (virtual size)
is also 223 vbytes. `vsize` is the number of weight units (`892`), of
the transaction divided by 4, so the virtual size of a non-segwit
transaction (which this is, because it only spends non-segwit outputs)
is equal to its actual `size`.

The locktime of this transaction is set to `549655` which was the height
of the strongest chain at the time of transaction creation. This means
that the transaction cannot be mined until block height 549656. This
is to reduce the attractiveness of an attack where a miner
deliberately tries to reorg the blockchain and include your
transaction into a block height that's already been mined.

Next comes the list of inputs. This transaction has a single input
that spends output at index `0` (`vout`) of the transaction with
`txid`
`8a4023dbcf57dc7f51d368606055e47636fc625a512d3481352a1eec909ab22f`. This
input spends a p2pkh output.

The sequence number of the input is `4294967293`, which is `fffffffd`
in hex code. This means that locktime is enabled (<=`fffffffe`), and
that the transaction is replaceable (<=`fffffffd`) according to
BIP125. The meaning of the sequence number was summarized in
<<tab0901>>.

After the list of inputs comes the list of transaction outputs. This
transaction has a list of 2 outputs. The first output pays 0.00313955
BTC to a p2pkh address that we haven't seen before. This is _probably_
a change output. The second output sends 0.005 BTC to the p2wpkh
address we created above.

Let's see if the transaction is confirmed yet. You can check for
example with `getbalance`. If it shows `0.00500000` it means that that
the transaction has confirmed:

----
$ ./bitcoin-cli getbalance
0.00500000
----

Cool, the money is confirmed! It's yours! Let's move on.

==== Send money

We have received some bitcoins. Now we want to send bitcoins to
someone else. To send bitcoins, you can use the `sendtoaddress`
command. We need to make a few decisions first:

* What address to send to: bc1qu456w7a5mawlg35y00xu03wp8wc7d65t7uulqm
* How much money to send: 0.001 BTC
* How urgent the transaction is: Not urgent (we're happy if it
  confirms within 20 blocks)

I will send the bitcoins to address `bc1qu456...ulqm`, but you should
get another address to send to. If you have no other wallet, you can
create a new address in Bitcoin Core to send to just for experimental
purposes. I've obfuscated my address below so that you don't send to
my address by mistake.

[.fullwidth]
----
$ ./bitcoin-cli -named sendtoaddress \
    address="bc1qu456w7a5mawlgXXXXXXu03wp8wc7d65t7uulqm" \
    amount=0.001 conf_target=20 estimate_mode=ECONOMICAL
error code: -13
error message:
Error: Please enter the wallet passphrase with walletpassphrase first.
----

Oh, dear! We got an error. As indicated by the error message, this is
because the private keys are encrypted in the `wallet.dat`
file. Bitcoin Core needs the private keys to sign the transaction. To
make the private keys accessible, you need to decrypt them. You do
that using the `walletpassphrase` command with the `-stdin` option to
prevent the passphrase from being stored by your command line
interpreter, for example bash.

----
$ ./bitcoin-cli -stdin walletpassphrase
secretpassword<ENTER>
300<ENTER>
<CTRL-D>
----

The last argument, `300`, is the number of seconds to keep the wallet
unlocked. After 300 seconds, the wallet will be automatically locked
again in case we forget to lock it manually. Let's retry our
`sendtoaddress` command again:

[.fullwidth]
----
$ ./bitcoin-cli -named sendtoaddress \
    address="bc1qu456w7a5mawlgXXXXXXu03wp8wc7d65t7uulqm" \
    amount=0.001 conf_target=20 estimate_mode=ECONOMICAL
a13bcb16d8f41851cab8e939c017f1e05cc3e2a3c7735bf72f3dc5ef4a5893a2
----

The command output a txid for the newly created transaction. This
means that it went well. We can now lock the wallet again using the
`walletlock` command:

----
$ ./bitcoin-cli walletlock
----

The wallet is now locked. Let's list our transactions again:

[.fullwidth]
----
$ ./bitcoin-cli listtransactions

The new transaction is the last one of the two. It is not yet
confirmed, as indicated by `"confirmations": 0`. The fee we paid was
141 satoshis. We will look into this transaction in detail:

The first thing to note is that the `txid` and `hash` differ.  That's
because this is a segwit transaction. As you may recall from <<ch10>>,
the witness is not included in the txid - that's how we avoid
transaction malleability - but the `hash` in the output above
includes it. We note that the `size` and `vsize` differ too, which is
expected from a segwit transaction. The fee was 141 satoshis, as shown
by the `listtransactions` command above, and the vsize is 141
vbytes. The fee-rate was thus selected by Bitcoin Core to be 1
sat/vbyte.

The transaction has a single input that spends output `1` of
transaction
`ebfd0d14c2ea74ce408d01d5ea79636b8dee88fe06625f5d4842d2a0ba45c195`. We
recognize this output from the section where we paid 0.005 BTC to our
Bitcoin Core wallet. Since that output was a p2wpkh output, the
signature script (`scriptSig`) is empty, and the `txinwitness`
contains the signature and pubkey.

The sequence number of the input is 4294967294 which equals
'fffffffe'. This means that the transaction has locktime enabled, but
is not replaceable using BIP125 (Opt-in replace by fee).

We have two outputs: The first one is the change of 0.00399859 back to
an address of our own. The other is the actual payment of 0.001 BTC.
Let's check our balance:

----
 ./bitcoin-cli getbalance
0.00399859
----

Yep, there it is. `getbalance` will show change outputs from
unconfirmed transction. We've spent our only UTXO (of 0.005 BTC) and
created a new UTXO of 0.00399859 to ourselves. So

----
Spent:   0.005
Pay:    -0.001
Fee:    -0.00000141
===================
Change:  0.00399859
----

It sums up perfectly.

We have shown a few commands you can use to wing your Bitcoin Core
node, but there's a lot more to it. Please explore `./bitcoin-cli
help` to find out more.

Questions to Christina

Link to wikipedia for SHA256? And for all hash functions in table in 2.2.5?

Remove "Hardened extended private key derivation"?

Remove hard part of "Throttle privacy and data traffic"?


Todo:

Open up port forwardings for node to increase connectivity and serve
others. Discuss implications of only having out-bound connections.

Update stats with css class "movingtarget" (done 2018-06-13)



Less important todos: 

Explain nothing-up-my-sleeve in ch04.

Explain why double SHA256 in "some-well-known-hash-functions" in ch2

Section on pruning

payment channel

lightning


Open questions:

* Does anyone here know why the sequence of other inputs are zeroed
  when signing with SIGHASH_NONE or SIGHASH_SINGLE? Doesn't that
  interfere with relative lock time and RBF opt-in?

Closed questions:

* Why do Bernanke outputs have values >0? Do they have to?
** No they don't have to. There's no policy agains value >0 today, and
   there (probably) weren't any back then.

* Can we really save storage and or bandwidth between full nodes with segwit?
** Yes, but not right now. Witnessless mode is not implemented.

* How can you make a relative lock-time transaction that is not opt-in RBF?
** opt-in RBF is seq<0xffffffff-1 while rel-lock-time is 0x7fffffff-0x00000000

* Is it possible that there are other yet unknown ways to malleate a signature than the "-S" trick? Or maybe even known ones? I refer only to inherent ECDSA signature malleability.
** Yes it's possible according to wumpus in bitcoin-core-dev
