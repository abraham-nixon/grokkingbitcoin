:imagedir: {baseimagedir}/ch03

This chapter covers

* receiving bitcoins
* understanding the peer-to-peer network
* the structure of the blockchain


Now that the introduction is out of the way, let us get more
hands-on. We will walk you through the installation of a Bitcoin
wallet and explain some fundamental concepts that are important for
wallets. Not only for wallets but for the whole Bitcoin system. 

The main objective of this chapter is to teach you how the wallet
manages your private keys and how addresses are generated from those
private keys.

Concrete example

Now that Bob have sent his Bitcoin address to Alice, Alice will create
a Bitcoin transaction. She will send that transaction on the Bitcoin
peer-to-peer network. Let's follow that transaction's jorney.

Diagram 1: Network of computers, and Alices wallet connected to 3 of
them. Bob's wallet is connected to 2. Alice's wallet sends the
transaction to all three.

2: The three computers validate the transaction and passes it on to
its neighbors.

3: Finally one of the nodes Bob is connected to will receive the
transactions. It will pass the transaction to Bob's wallet.
