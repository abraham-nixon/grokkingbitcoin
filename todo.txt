造 Chapter3:
=== Bitcoin addresses

Bitcoin uses the exact same kind of addresses as we use in our
spreadsheet. But historically public keys were encoded differently in
Bitcoin, requiring 65 bytes instead of 33. John's public key would
have looked like this:

 045541a13851a3742489fdddeef21be13c1abb85e053222c0dbf3703ba218dc1f
 32705967aec1cc5118c920c83d0ba8142dce1eeb4d8ed531c152c8ff85f2d8b33

This made the rationale behind the hashing of the public keys more
clear. There was a stronger incentive to shorten the public keys.


造 Explain how cookie tokens are first created! I suggest that
we use Bitcoin's model where Alice gets 50 CT every 10 minutes. Let's
be generous, 7200 CT per day.
