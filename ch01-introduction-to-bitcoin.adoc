== Introduction to Bitcoin
:imagedir: {baseimagedir}/ch01

This chapter covers

* Getting to know Bitcoin
* Following a Bitcoin payment
* Problems solved by Bitcoin

This book will hopefully teach you enough about Bitcoin so that you
can make informed decisions on how you can use Bitcoin to improve your
private life or your business. My hope is that you will learn
enough to make up your own mind whether you trust Bitcoin or not,
hopefully the former. In order to get you off the ground, I'm going to
assume that you know roughly what the following terms mean:

* computer program
* database
* computer network
* web server

If you're unsure of any of these terms, don't worry. Either look them
up or just go ahead anyway, I think you'll manage.

=== What is Bitcoin?

[.inbitcoin]
.Bitcoin or bitcoin?
****
The system is named Bitcoin with capital B. The currency unit is
called bitcoin with lowercase b. Commonly used symbols for bitcoin are
{btc}, BTC and XBT. We will mostly use BTC in this book.
****

Bitcoin is a digital cash system. It allows for people to move
bitcoins, the currency unit of Bitcoin, between each other without
using a bank or any other trusted third party. It resembles
traditional bank notes and coins in that way, but it is purely digital
and used over the Internet. The Bitcoin currency is not tied to any
specific _fiat currency_ like the US dollar or the Chinese Renminbi;
It has free floating exchange rates against all fiat currencies. You
can buy and sell bitcoins for fiat currencies online using one of
several exchanges, for example kraken.com, bitstamp.net and
coinbase.com.

No government or company is controlling Bitcoin. Instead, thousands of
computers around the globe, the Bitcoin network, collectively keep the
system working day and night, seven days a week. You don't need to
register or sign up anywhere to use Bitcoin, you just need Internet
access and a computer program, like a mobile app to use it.

Anyone can use or participate in the Bitcoin network without special
permission from a bank or similar institution. Thanks to this
_permissionless_ nature of Bitcoin, a lot of Bitcoin related
technology has emerged over the years. The participants in this
Bitcoin ecosystem can be roughly categorized into several groups:

.The Bitcoin network and its ecosystem.
image::{imagedir}/actors.svg[{full-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.Bitcoin doesn't care
****
The Bitcoin network doesn't distinguish between users. No user is more
important than any other user. It doesn't matter who they are or what
they do, everyone participate on the same terms.
****

End users:: These are people using Bitcoin for their day-to-day
needs. It can be for example savings, shopping, speculation, or
salary.
Corporate users:: Companies using Bitcoin to solve their business
needs, for example paying wages internationally, or use cases similar
to those of the end users.
Merchants:: For example a restaurant or a book store accepting Bitcoin
payments.
Bitcoin services:: Companies providing Bitcoin related services to its
customers. For example top-up mobile phones, anonymization services,
remittance services or tipping services.
Exchanges:: A commercial service people can use to exchange their
local currency to and from bitcoin.
Protocols on top:: Systems can be built on top of bitcoin. Payment
networks, specialized tokens and decentralized exchanges are all
examples of _protocols_ that operate "on top" of Bitcoin to perform
certain tasks.
Bitcoin developers:: People working, often for free, with the computer
programs that the participants of the Bitcoin network are running.

The Bitcoin network's job is to process Bitcoin payments. The network
consists of thousands of computers around the world. We call those
computers Bitcoin nodes or just nodes. Any of the actors mentioned
above can also participate actively in the Bitcoin network by running
their own Bitcoin node. You must run your own node if you don't want
to trust others to provide you with correct financial information.

=== The big picture

.The periscope
****
image::{commonimagedir}/periscope.gif[]
****

We will use the figures from this subsection every now and then
throughout the book to help you with orientation. It's easy to lose
track of the big picture and what the goal of the current
topic is. Look for the periscope picture and section headers like
"Where were we?".

The Bitcoin network is a network of computers running Bitcoin
software. The Bitcoin network verifies and confirms payments between
Bitcoin users.

Suppose that Alice wants to make a payment of 1 BTC to Bob. The
payment starts with Alice creating a _transaction_ and sending it to
the Bitcoin network.

.A Bitcoin payment. The payment is processed in 4 steps.
[[payment-overview]]
image::{imagedir}/payment-overview.svg[{full-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.I thought Bitcoin was anonymous?
****
Bitcoin doesn't use names or any other personal information, but we
use names in this first example for simplicity.
****

This figure will follow us in each intro of chapter 2 through 8 where
we point out what in this figure we will cover in the chapter. Now,
let's follow Alice's payment from Alice to Bob:

1. Alice creates and signs a transaction that moves 1 bitcoin from her
to Bob. She then sends it to the Bitcoin network.
2. The computers in the network, the Bitcoin nodes, check that Alice
actually has the money to spend and that the tx is authentic. They
then pass the transaction on to their neighbors, called peers.
3. Each computer updates its own copy of the Bitcoin blockchain, the
ledger, with the new payment information.
4. The network notifies Bob that he has received 1 bitcoin.

Note how Alice does not really _send_ 1 bitcoin to Bob, but asks the
Bitcoin network to move 1 bitcoin from Alice to Bob in the Bitcoin
blockchain.

[.important]
The Bitcoin blockchain is a database that each computer
in the Bitcoin network has a copy of. Think of the blockchain as a
ledger of all transactions ever made.

We will go through these steps a bit closer in the next four sections,
one step per section.

[id=overview-transactions]
==== Step 1 - Transactions

[.gbinfo]
.Transaction
****
A transaction is a payment. Sometimes we also say transfer. We will
use the terms interchangeably. We cover transactions in <<ch05>> and <<ch09>>.
****

Step 1 of the process is when Alice asks the network to move 1 bitcoin
to Bob. She asks by sending a Bitcoin _transaction_ to the Bitcoin
network. The transaction contains instructions on how to move the
money and a _digital signature_ that proves that it is actually Alice
that requests to move the money.

[id=bitcoin_payment]
.Step 1: Alice creates a transaction, signs it and sends it to one or more Bitcoin nodes in the Bitcoin network.
image::{imagedir}/payment-overview-step-1.svg[{half-width}]

The Bitcoin _transaction_ is a piece of data specifying

* the amount to move (1 bitcoin)
* the Bitcoin address to move the money to (Bob's Bitcoin address `15vwoaN74MBeF5nr2BH4DKqndEFjHA6MzT`)
* a _digital signature_ (made with Alice's private key)

[.gbinfo]
.Digital signatures
****
We discuss digital signatures in-depth in <<ch02>>.
****

The digital signature is created from the transaction and a huge
secret number, called a _private key_, that only Alice has
access to. The result is a digital signature that only the owner of
the private key could have created.

Alice's mobile wallet app is connected to one or more nodes in the
Bitcoin network, and sends the transaction to those nodes.

==== Step 2 - The Bitcoin network

Alice has sent a transaction to one or more Bitcoin nodes. In step 2
of the process, each such node checks that the transaction is valid
and passes it on to its peers. It does that by consulting its local
copy of the blockchain and verifying that

* the bitcoin that Alice spends exist and that it is not already spent
* Alice's digital signature is valid.

[id=overview-bitcoin-network]
.Alice has sent her transaction to a node in the network. The node will verify the transaction and forward it to other nodes. Eventually the transaction has reached all nodes in the network.
image::{imagedir}/payment-overview-step-2.svg[{full-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.Bad transactions
****
Invalid transactions are dropped. They will not reach further than the
first node.
****

If all checks pass, a node will forward the transaction to the nodes
it is connected to in the Bitcoin network. This is known as
_relaying_. Alice's transaction would shortly have traveled the whole
network while being verified by each node along the way. The
blockchain has not been updated yet, that's the next step.

==== Step 3 - The blockchain

[.inbitcoin]
.The blockchain
****
The names comes from how the ledger is structured. It uses blocks that
are chained together in such a way that modifications to the
blockchain can be detected. More on that in <<ch06>>.
****

In step 3, nodes update their local copies of the Bitcoin blockchain
with Alice's transaction. The blockchain contains historic information
about all previous transactions, and new transactions, such as
Alice's, are appended to it every now and then.

It is not as straightforward as it may seem to update the blockchain
with Alice's transaction. Alice's transaction is not the only
transaction that goes on. There are possibly thousands of transactions
in-flight at the same time in the Bitcoin network. If all nodes would
just update their copy of the blockchain as they receive transactions
the copies would not remain copies for long, because the transactions
may come in different order on different nodes:

.Transactions arrives in different order at different nodes. If they would all write the transactions to the blockchain, the different nodes' blockchains would differ.
image::{imagedir}/transactions-unordered.svg[{full-width}]

To coordinate the ordering of transactions, one node takes the lead
saying "I want to add these 2 transactions to the blockchain in the
order B, A!". This message, known as a _block_, is sent out on the
network by that leader, in the same way as the transaction was sent by
Alice.

.One node takes the lead and tells the others what order to add the transactions in. The other nodes verify the block and update their blockchain copies accordingly.
image::{imagedir}/payment-overview-step-3.svg[{full-width}]

[.gbinfo]
.The blockchain is append-only
****
New transactions are added to the end of the blockchain only. It grows
only from the end.
****

As nodes see this block, they update their copy of the blockchain
according to the message, and pass the message on to its
neighbors. Alice's transaction was one of the transactions in the
block and is now part of the blockchain.

Why would a node want to take the lead? It's because the node that
takes the lead is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins and transaction
fees payed by the transactions it includes in the block.

But, wouldn't every node constantly take the lead to collect the
rewards? No, to take the lead, a node must solve a hard problem. This
takes plenty of time and electricity for the node, which ensures that
leaders don't pop up very often. It is so hard that most nodes in the
network don't even try. The nodes that do try are called _miners_
because they mine new coins, similar to a gold miner digging for
gold. This process is described in <<ch07>>.

[id=overview-wallets]
==== Step 4 - Wallets

Bob and Alice are users of the Bitcoin network, and they both need
some computer program to interact with the network. Such a program is
called a _Bitcoin wallet_. There are several different types of
Bitcoin wallets for several different devices, like mobile phones and
desktop computers, even specialized hardware wallet devices.

Before step 4 of the payment process, the nodes in the network have
updated their local copy of the blockchain. Now the network needs to
notify Alice and Bob that the transaction went through.

[id=wallet-connection]
.Bob's wallet have asked a node to notify the wallet upon activity in his Bitcoin address. Alice pays to Bob's address, and the node has just written the transaction to the blockchain, so it notifies Bob's wallet.
image::{imagedir}/payment-overview-step-4.svg[{full-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.Wallet duties
****
A typical Bitcoin wallet will

* Manage keys
* Watch incoming/outgoing bitcoins
* Send bitcoins
****

Bob's wallet is connected to some of the nodes in the Bitcoin
network. When a transaction concerning Bob is added to the blockchain,
the nodes that Bob's wallet is connected to will notify Bob's
wallet. The wallet will then display a message to Bob that he just
received one bitcoin. Alice also use a wallet. Her wallet will also be
notified of her own transaction.

Besides sending and receiving transactions, Bob's and Alice's wallets
also manage their private keys for them. The private keys are used to
create digital signatures. Alice created her digital signature with
one of her private keys. When Bob later wants to spend the money he
received to his Bitcoin address, he needs to create a transaction and
digitally sign it with the private key corresponding to that Bitcoin
address.

=== Problems with money today

Bitcoin would not be this widespread if it didn't solve real problems
for real people. Bitcoin solves several problems of the traditional
financial system. Let us look at some commonly discussed problem
areas.

==== Segregation

People with bank accounts and access to banking services like on-line
payments or loans are very privileged. About 38% of the world
population don't have a bank account at all according to the World
Bank, see <<web-financial-inclusion>>. The numbers are slowly
improving but still a lot of people are stuck in a cash-only
environment.

Without a bank account and basic bank services like on-line payments,
people can not expand their businesses outside of their local
community. A tailor will not be able to offer services on the Internet
to increase its customer base. A person living in a rural area may
have to travel half a day just to pay a utility bill or top-up their
prepaid mobile phone.

.Problems
****
- [ ] *Segregation*
****

This segregation between banked people and unbanked people is driven
by a number of factors:

* Banking services are too expensive for some people.
* In order to use bank services you need documentation, like an ID
  card, that many people don't have.
* Banking services may be denied to people with certain political
  views or people conducting certain businesses. People may also be
  denied service due to their ethnicity, sexual preferences, or skin
  color.

[id=privacy-issues]
==== Privacy issues

****
image::{imagedir}/privacy-issue-mastercard.svg[]
****

There are several privacy problems with traditional money, when it
comes to electronic payments like credit cards or bank
transfers. States can easily

* trace payments
* censor payments
* freeze funds
* seize funds

You might say, "I have nothing to hide, and the government need these
tools to fight crime". The problem is that you do not know what your
government looks like in five years and how that government defines
crime. New laws are just an election away. After next election, your
government may pass a law that allows freezing funds of people with
your political view. There are places in the world where this is
happening.

.Problems
****
- [ ] Segregation
- [ ] *Privacy issues*
****

We have seen lots of examples where these abilities are misused to
disable someone's ability to transact. For example, the non-profit
organization WikiLeaks was put under a blockade in 2010, see
<<web-wikileaks-blockade>>, where all donations through traditional
channels were blocked after pressure from the US government on the
major payment networks, like Visa and MasterCard. We have also seen
how Cyprus seized 47.5% [<<web-cyprus-seizure>>] of all bank deposits
exceeding 100,000 € as part of a financial rescue program in 2013.

Worth noting here is that bank notes and coins are usually not
affected. As long as there is cash, people can trade freely and
privately. In some parts of the world, for example Sweden, cash is
being phased out, which means that soon you will not be able to buy a
chewing gum without being recorded by someone.

==== Inflation

Inflation means that the purchasing power of a currency
decreases.

.Problems
****
- [ ] Segregation
- [ ] Privacy issues
- [ ] *Inflation*
****

.Inflation
image::{imagedir}/inflation.svg[{big-width}]

Most currencies are subject to inflation. Some more than others. For
example the Zimbabwean dollar inflated nearly 10^23^% during
2007-2008, peaking at 80 billion percent per month during a few months
in 2008. That is an average daily inflation rate of nearly
100%. Prices roughly doubled every day.

Extreme cases of inflation like this are called
hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is usually driven by a rapid increase
in the money supply. Governments sometimes increase the money supply
as a tool to extract value from its population to pay for expenses
like national debt, warfare or welfare. If this tool is over-used, the
risk of hyperinflation is apparent.

A rapid increase in the money supply will most likely lead to a
depreciation of the currency. This in turn pushes people to exchange
their local currency for goods, or alternative currencies, that better
holds value, which further drives the value of the currency down. This
can spiral down to extremes like in Zimbabwe. The result is
devastating for people as they see their life savings diminish to
virtually nothing.

[.movingtarget]
.Some hyperinflations in modern time. Source: Wikipedia
|===
|Country | Year | Worst monthly inflation [%]

|Zimbabwe | 2007-2008 | 4.19*10^16^
|Yugoslavia | 1992-1994 | 313*10^6^
|Peru | 1990 | 397
|Ukraine | 1992-1994 | 285
|Venezuela | 2016-2017 | 120
|===

Zimbabwe is one of the most extreme cases of inflation throughout
history, but still today some countries suffer from very high
inflation. One of them is Venezuela where its currency, the bolívar,
experienced a 480% inflation during 2016, and during 2017 it suffered
from about 4,000% inflation. A staggering 15,000% inflation is forcast
for 2018.

==== Borders

Moving value across national borders using national, or _fiat_,
currency is hard, expensive and sometimes even forbidden. If you want
to send 1,000 Swedish crowns (SEK) from Sweden to a person in the
Philippines, you can use a service like Western Union for the
transfer. At the time I investigated this, 1,000 SEK was worth 5,305
Philippine Pesos (PHP) or 109 US dollars.

.Cost of sending 5305 PHP from Sweden to Philippines
|===
| Send from | Receive to | Received by recipient | Fees | Fees %

| Bank | Bank | 5,109 PHP | 265 PHP | 4.9%
| Bank | Cash | 4,810 PHP | 564 PHP | 10.5%
| Credit card | Cash | 4,498 PHP | 876 PHP | 16.3%
|===

If the recipient has a bank account with the capability of receiving
international money transfer, we could get away with a 4.9% fee. But a
typical remittance recipient will only be able to receive cash, which
doubles or triples the cost to 10.5% or 16.3% depending on how quick
or convenient you want it.

.Problems
****
- [ ] Segregation
- [ ] Privacy
- [ ] Inflation
- [ ] *Borders*
****

To contrast the above, moving fiat currency within the borders of a
nation state is usually very convenient. For example, you can hand
over cash directly to the recipient, or transfer money using some
mobile app made specifically for the currency. As long as you stay
within one country and one currency, fiat currencies usually do a
pretty good job.

=== The Bitcoin approach

Bitcoin offers a fundamentally different model than traditional
financial institutions. Let us explore the major differences one
by one.

[id=decentralized]
==== Decentralized

Instead of a central organization controlling the currency, like the
US Federal Reserve, the control is distributed among thousands of
computers, called _Bitcoin nodes_ or just _nodes_. No single node or
group of nodes have more privileges or obligations than any other
node. This equality between nodes makes Bitcoin _decentralized_, as
opposed to _centralized_ systems like banks or the Google search
engine.

.Centralized and decentralized services
image::{imagedir}/centralized-decentralized.svg[{half-width}]

In a centralized system, the service is controlled by a single entity
like a bank. It implies that this single entity can decide who gets to
use the service and what the user is allowed to do. For example an
on-line video service may chose to provide a video only to people in a
certain geographical location.

- [*] *Privacy*
- [ ] Inflation
- [ ] Borders
****

With a decentralized system like Bitcoin, with several thousands of
nodes spread around the globe, it is extremely hard to control how and
by whom the system is used. No matter where or who they are, or whom
they are sending money to, the Bitcoin system will treat all users
equally. There is no central point in the Bitcoin system that can be
exploited to censor payments, deny users service or seize funds.

Bitcoin is permissionless, which means that you don't need to ask
anyone for permission to participate. Anyone with a computer and an
Internet connection can set up a Bitcoin node and take an active role
in the Bitcoin network. No questions asked. No registration.

It is nearly impossible to change the rules of the currency without
broad consensus. If a node does not obey the rules it will be ignored
by the rest. For example, one rule is that the money supply of Bitcoin
is limited to 21,000,000 bitcoins. That limit is nearly impossible to
change because of decentralization.

[id=limited_supply]
==== Limited supply

[.inbitcoin]
.Fixed
****
- [*] Segregation
- [*] Privacy
- [*] *Inflation*
- [ ] Borders
****

A hard promise of Bitcoin is that its money supply will not exceed 21
million bitcoins. People can be sure that if they own one bitcoin,
they will _always_ own at least one 21 millionth of the total supply
of bitcoins. This feature is not found in any fiat currency, where
decisions on the supply is made every so often by a company or a
state. Bitcoin is very resistant to high inflation because there is no
way to increase the money supply at will.

The money supply of Bitcoin is actually not fixed today. It is
increasing, at a diminishing rate, according to a _predetermined_
schedule and will eventually stop increasing around year 2140.

.The supply of bitcoins over time
image::{imagedir}/money-supply.svg[{half-width}]

[.movingtarget]

As of writing, the money supply is about 17 million bitcoins and the
current yearly increase in the money supply is about 4%, but the
increase is halved every four years.

==== Borderless

[.inbitcoin]
.Fixed
****
- [*] Segregation
- [*] Privacy
- [*] Inflation
- [*] *Borders*
****

Since Bitcoin is a system run by ordinary computers connected to the
Internet, the Bitcoin system is as global as the Internet itself. This
means that anyone with an Internet connection can send money to other
people across the world.

.Bitcoin is borderless
image::{imagedir}/borderless.svg[{big-width}]

There is no difference between sending a bitcoin to someone in the
same room or sending it to someone on another continent. The
experience is the same: Money is sent directly to the recipient, who
will see the payment nearly instantaneously and within about 60
minutes the recipient can be _sure_ that the money is hers. Once
settled, there is no way of reversing the transfer without the
recipient's consent.

=== How is Bitcoin used?

So far we have touched on a few common use cases for Bitcoin. This
section will dig deeper into those use cases and a few others. It is
hard to predict what use cases we will see in the future. Let us stick
to what we know now.

==== Savings

****
image::{imagedir}/vault.png[]
****

One interesting feature of Bitcoin is that you keep your money safe by
storing a set of _private keys_. Private keys are the secret pieces of
information that you will need when you want to spend your money. You
chose how those private keys are stored. You can write them on paper,
or you can store them electronically with a mobile app to have easy
access to them. You can also memorize the private keys. The private
keys are also all that is needed to spend your money. Keep them safe.

This makes savings an attractive use case for Bitcoin. A simple way to
save is to create a private key and write it down on a piece of paper
that you store in a safe. That piece of paper is now your savings
account, your savings _wallet_. You can then send bitcoins to your
wallet. As long as your private key is kept safe, your money is
safe. There are a lot of different saving schemes you can chose from
to find the right balance between security and convenience. For
example, you can keep them unencrypted in your mobile phone for easy
access, or store them encrypted on paper in a vault with armed guards.

==== Cross-border payments

As noted before, it is very expensive (say 15%) to move money from one
country to another, especially if you move money to a poor country and
the recipient doesn't have a bank account. It is becoming increasingly
popular to use Bitcoin to circumvent this expensive and slow legacy
system. It is usually cheaper to exchange SEK for bitcoins in Sweden,
and transfer the bitcoins to your friend in the Philippines. Your
friend will then exchange the bitcoins locally for Philippine
Pesos, PHP.

There are also companies offering such services so that you simply pay
SEK to the company and the company pays out PHP to your friend.

image::{imagedir}/remittance-company.svg[{big-width}]

You will not even know that Bitcoin is used under the hood. They will
typically charge a few percent for the service, but it will still be
cheaper than traditional remittance services.

Of course, if the recipient can make good use of Bitcoin where he
lives, there is no need for a middle-man that takes a cut of the
money. You would send bitcoins directly to your friend. This is what
Bitcoin is all about. Exchanges and other such service companies are
just bridges between the old legacy world and the new Bitcoin world.

==== Shopping

****
image::{imagedir}/shopping-cart.png[]
****

The most obvious use case for Bitcoin is to use it for shopping. The
borderlessness and security of Bitcoin makes it ideal for on-line
payments for goods and services.

In traditional on-line payments, you send your debit card details to
the merchant, and _hope_ that the merchant will withdraw as much as
you agreed on. You also _hope_ that the merchant handles your debit
card details with great care. They probably store the details in a
database. Think about that; For every debit card purchase you make,
your card details will be stored in that merchant's database. It is
quite likely that _one_ of the databases gets hacked and your card
details are stolen. The more merchants that store your details, the
higher the risk.

With Bitcoin, you don't have that problem, because you don't send any
sensitive information to the merchant, or anyone else. You transfer
the amount of money that you agreed upon, and nothing more.

==== Speculation

The world is full of people wanting to get rich quick. Bitcoin can be
very alluring to them because of the price _volatility_, or tendency
to change. Looking at the history of the bitcoin price, it is very
tempting to try to buy when it is low and sell when it is high.

[.movingtarget]
.Price in USD since beginning of Bitcoin
image::{imagedir}/bitcoin-price.png[{half-width}]

[.movingtarget]

In November 2013, the price climbed from about $100 (US dollars) to
over $1100 in a few weeks. This was clearly a so called _bubble_,
where people were afraid of missing out on a great rise, so they
bought in, driving the price further up, until it eventually started
dropping again. The drop to 50% of its peak value was just as quick as
its rise. This has happened many times already. Fluctuations like this
is rarely driven by any specific news or technological advancements,
but from speculation.

It does happen that some government or big corporation makes a
negative statement that creates fear in the market, but those events
tend to have a limitied effect on the value of bitcoin.

Speculation can be fun, if you can afford to lose, but it is more like
a lottery than something to make a living from.

The volatility in Bitcoin price seems contradictory to the claims of
non-inflationary property; A 50% drop in market value seems pretty
inflationary. Bitcoin is still relatively new, and lots of short-term
speculation causes this volatility. But as Bitcoin grows and more
people and institutions start using Bitcoin to store their wealth, it
will probably stabilize in the long run. So the deflationary property
of Bitcoin will emerge over time.

==== Non-currency uses

Bitcoin is digital cash, but this form of cash can be used for other
things beyond money. This section covers two common uses, but there
are others including not yet invented uses.

===== Ownership

****
image::{imagedir}/transfer-ownership.svg[]
****

Bitcoin allow you to embed small pieces of data with payments. This
data can be for example a chassis number of a car. When the car leaves
the factory, the manufacturer can make a small Bitcoin payment,
containing the chassis number, to the new car owner. This payment will
then represent the transfer of ownership for that car.

Bitcoin payments are public records but they are not tied to persons
in any way. They are tied to long strings of numbers called public
keys. The car manufacturer has made its public key publicly available
on their website, in newspapers and advertisement, to tie the public
key to the identity of the manufacturer. Anyone can then verify that
the manufacturer has transferred ownership of the car to the new
owner. The new owner can show that she owns the car by proving that
she owns the private key belonging to the public key that the
manufacturer transferred ownership to.

The new owner can sell the car to someone else and transfer ownership
by sending the very same bitcoins she got from the manufacturer to the
new owner's public key. The general public can follow the ownership of
the car from the manufacturer through every owner's public key up to
the current owner.

===== Proof of existence

Using the same technique to store data in a Bitcoin payment to
transfer ownership of a car, you can prove that a document existed
prior to a certain point in time.

****
image::{imagedir}/proof-of-existence.svg[]
****

A digital document has a "fingerprint", a cryptographic hash, that
anyone can calculate from that document. It is nearly impossible to
create a different document with the same fingerprint. This
fingerprint can be attached to a Bitcoin payment. It is irrelevant
where the money goes; The important thing is that the fingerprint is
recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain. You "anchor" the document in the
blockchain.

Bitcoin payments are public records, so anyone can verify that the
document existed before the time of the payment by taking the
fingerprint of the document and compare it to the fingerprint stored
in the blockchain.

==== How is Bitcoin valued?

****
image::{imagedir}/market.svg[]
****

As you could read in section <<_speculation>>, the price of a bitcoin
can fluctuate quite dramatically. But where is this price actually
coming from? There are several Bitcoin exchanges, mostly Internet
based. They resemble stock markets, where users wanting to sell
bitcoins are matched with users wanting to buy bitcoins.

Different markets can have different market prices depending on the
supply and demand on that market. For example, in countries like
Venezuela where the government tries to hinder the Bitcoin market, the
supply will be low. But the demand is high, because people want to
escape from their hyperinflating currency. These factors drive the
Bitcoin price up in that market compared to for example the US and
European markets where people can trade more freely.

==== When not to use Bitcoin

Bitcoin is nice and all, but it's not suitable for all sorts of
financial activity. At least not yet.

===== Tiny payments

Each transaction needs to pay a fee to be processed. The fee is not
related to the amount sent, but to how big the transaction is in
bytes. This is because the network's cost for processing a transaction
depends mostly on how big (in bytes) the transaction is. High-value
transactions are not bigger (in bytes) than low-value transactions, so
the fee is about the same for both kinds of transactions. The fee
required for a transaction also depends on supply and demand for
available space in the blockchain. The blockchain can't handle more
than roughly 12MB of transactions per hour, which means that miners
will sometimes have to prioritize transactions. Paying a higher fee
will probably give your transaction a higher priority.

If the fee is a significant share of the actual payment you want to
make, it is not economically viable to pay with ordinary Bitcoin
transactions.

|===
| Amount | Fee | Fee % | Feasible

| 2 BTC | 0.003 BTC | 0.15% | Yes
| 0.002 BTC | 0.001 BTC | 50% | Probably not
| 0.001 BTC | 0.005 BTC | 500% | No

There are however very promising emerging technologies being built on
top of Bitcoin. One example is the Lightning Network, that allows for
cheap, instantaneous micropayments of tiny fractions of a
bitcoin. Using Lightning Network, you can pay just 100 satoshis (1
satoshi = 0.000,000,01 BTC) at a fee of, for example, 1 satoshi.

===== Instant payments

Bitcoin payments takes time to confirm. A typical payment will confirm
within 20 minutes. The recipient will see the payment immediately, but
he shouldn't trust the payment until it is confirmed by the Bitcoin
network. This limitation can also be fixed by systems built on top of
Bitcoin, for example the Lightning Network.

The confirmation time of Bitcoin is nowhere near the confirmation
times of VISA or MasterCard, where a merchant must wait for weeks
[<<web-chargebacks>>] before
being sure that the transaction is not reversed. Merchants usually
take on some risk to avoid having their customers wait weeks before
delivering the goods or service. Bitcoin cuts this waiting period
significantly, but it is still too long for truly instant payments.

===== Savings you can not afford to lose

Bitcoin is probably the most secure money there is, but it is still in
its infancy. Things _could_ go bad with Bitcoin, for example:

[.inbitcoin]
.Bitcoin security
****
You are in charge of the security of your bitcoins. Only you. Be
careful!
****

* You lose your private keys, the secret data needed to spend your
  money.
* Your private keys get stolen by some bad guy.
* The government in your location may try to crack down on Bitcoin
  users by imprisonment or other means of force.
* The price of bitcoin can swing down dramatically due to rumors or
  speculation.
* There may be software bugs that can make Bitcoin insecure.
* There may be weaknesses in the cryptography used by Bitcoin.

While all of the above risks are _possible_, most of them are
unlikely. The list is somewhat ordered with the most likely at
the top. Always weigh the risks before putting money on the line and
select your security measures accordingly. This book will help you
understand the risks and how to secure your money.

[[altcoins]]
=== Other cryptocurrencies

This book will cover Bitcoin. But there are several other so-called
cryptocurrencies, and new ones pop up all the time. Cryptocurrencies
other than Bitcoin are often referred to as _alt-coins_, alternative
coins. I will list a few popular alt-coins along with their purpose
and so-called market capitalization, market cap. The market cap is the
product of the money supply (number of coins) and the current market
price per coin. Note that the market cap will most likely have changed
a lot when you read this. I include it only to give you a glimpse of
Bitcoin's position relative to the other cryptocurrencies.

I encourage you to look up these cryptocurrencies as they all provide
interesting new features beyond Bitcoin. There are hundreds of other
alt-coins. Some alt-coins, for example the ones above, provide some
unique features that are not available in Bitcoin, and some provide
little to nothing innovative. Anyone can create an alt-coin by taking
any existing cryptocurrency software and modify it to her needs.

.Network effect
****
image::{imagedir}/network-effect.svg[]
****

Let's say that Sheila wants to start an alt-coin, Wowcoin. She takes
the Bitcoin software and changes the max money supply to 11,000,000,
instead of Bitcoin's 21,000,000, coins and starts. When Wowcoin is
started she will be very lonely, because no one else is using her
alt-coin. If she wants Wowcoin to have some real value, she has got to
convince other people to start using her alt-coin. If she's not
providing anything innovative, she's going to have a hard time getting
other people on-board, since they are pretty happy with what Bitcoin
is already providing. Everybody else is using Bitcoin, so why would
you use Wowcoin? Think of it as starting a new internet, that you call
Wownet. People on Wownet will not be able to use services on the
Internet. Conversely, people on the Internet will not be able to use
your service if you are on Wownet. So why would anyone use Wownet? We
call it the network effect; People tend to go where other people are.

=== Recap

In this chapter you learned that

* Bitcoin is global, borderless money, that anyone with an internet
  connection can use.
* Bitcoin is used by many different actors, like savers, merchants,
  traders for many different purposes like payments, remittances and
  savings.
* A network of computers, the Bitcoin network, verifies and keeps
  records of all payments.
* A transaction goes through four steps: Send transaction, verify
  transaction, add transaction to blockchain, notify recipient wallet.
* It solves problems with inflation, borders, segregation and privacy
  by providing limited supply, decentralization and borderlessness.
* There are several alternative cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin,
  for example Ethereum, Zcash and Namecoin.
* A (crypto)currency needs to have enough users and activity to be
  useful. It's called network effect.
