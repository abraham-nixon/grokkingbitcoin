    <h2>Front matter, page xx, preface</h2>
    <p>The text "... trying to find a my place in the Bitcoin
      community ..." in the third paragraph should read "... trying to
      find <strong>a</strong> place in the Bitcoin community ..."</p>
    
    <h2>Back cover</h2>
    <p>The author's company name is misspelled in the Author Bio. The
      correct spelling is <strong>Popeller</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4, page 87</h2>
    <p>In the list of wallet duties, "Back up private
    key<strong>s</strong>" should be all italics. The
    trailing <strong>s</strong> is not.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4, page 111</h2>
    <p>The header "Public key multiplication" should be one level down
      under the "Public key math" header. The other headers under
      "Public key math" should remain, so that "Public key
      multiplication" is on the same level as for example "Why is this
      secure?".</p>
    
    <h2>Appendix B, page 436, answer 9.9 and 9.10</h2>
    <p>The last sentence, "The node will thus never know ...", of
      answer 9.10 is misplaced. It should be the last sentence of
      answer 9.9.</p>
