    <h2>Table of contents</h2>
    <p>The section "Recap of payment types" is missing in the table of
      contents for chapter 10. It should be right before the "Block
      limits" section.</p>
    
    <h2>Front matter, page xx, preface</h2>
    <p>The text "... trying to find a my place in the Bitcoin
      community ..." in the third paragraph should read "... trying to
      find <strong>a</strong> place in the Bitcoin community ...".</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2, page 46</h2>
    <p>In the last paragraph, "... can encrypt messages that can only
    the public key can decrypt" should be changed to "... can
    encrypt messages that only the public key can decrypt". Thanks to
    Dan Berglund.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3, page 63</h2>
    <p>The first sentence of the last paragraph mentions
    "<strong>pubic</strong> keys". The author should have kept his
    mind on the subject and written "<strong>public</strong>
    keys".</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4, page 87</h2>
    <p>In the list of wallet duties, "Back up private
      key<strong>s</strong>" should be all italics. The
      trailing <strong>s</strong> is not.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4, page 111</h2>
    <p>The header "Public key multiplication" should be one level down
      under the "Public key math" header. The other headers under
      "Public key math" should remain, so that "Public key
      multiplication" is on the same level as for example "Why is this
      secure?".</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4, page 115, figure 4.28</h2>
    <p>The bottom left annotations misspells multiplication as
    "multipilication".</p>

    <h2>Chapter 6, page 189</h2>
    <p>In the section "Verifying the partial merkle tree", the
      reference to figure 2.28 is wrong. It should reference figure
      6.28.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 7, page 212, figure 7.8</h2>
    <p>The annotation "Qi abandon her branch." should be "Qi abandons
    her branch.".</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 7, page 228, figure 7.23</h2>
    <p>The hands of the clock on the wall in the figure are not
    consistent. It should show 7:47; the hour hand should be moved
    back slightly.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 7, page 228, figure 7.23</h2>
    <p>The bottom right annotation misspells "That&#x2019;s" as
    "Thay&#x2019;s"</p>

    <h2>Chapter 7, page 229, table 7.2</h2>
    <p>The row next to last shows "... 1h 2min" in the right column,
      it should say "... 1h 2 min".</p>

    <h2>Chapter 8, page 257, figure 8.5</h2>
    <p>Bob's phone says "You are about to received 1 bitcoin". It
    should be "receive" instead.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 8, page 296</h2>
    <p>In th first paragraph, the height 54398 is wrong. It should be
    549398. Thanks to Dan Berglund.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 9, page 320</h2>
    <p>In the paragraph directly preceeding figure 9.15, the figure
      reference "Figure 9.14" is wrong. It should say "Figure
      9.15".</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10, page 350</h2>
    <p>The sidebar titled "Nonstandard transactions" doesn't use curly
      apostrophes '&#x2019;'.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10, page 354, figure 10.21</h2>
    <p>The hash function should be SHA256 (single SHA256), not dSHA256
    (double SHA256)</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10, page 355</h2>
    <p>First paragraph says "... because that's a double SHA256 of a
      witness script". Remove the word "double" because it's actually
      a single SHA256 hash.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 10, page 355</h2>
    <p>Last paragraph of section "Spending the p2wsh transaction" ends
      with a double period, "..". It should end with single period
      ".".</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10, page 356, figure 10.25</h2>
    <p>The hash function should be SHA256 (single SHA256), not dSHA256
    (double SHA256)</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10, page 362</h2>
    <p>The figure after Figure 10.34, is labeled as "Figure 10.3",
      when it should be labeled as "Figure 10.35".</p>

    <h2>Chapter 11, page 397</h2>
    <p>The third paragraph, which discusses the risks involved in
    BIP148, says "It could cause a chain split if a majority of the
    hash rate didn't signal for segwit.". This is misleading. Instead
    it should say "It would cause a chain split if a miner published a
    non-segwit-signalling block.". Thanks to Sjors Provoost for
    pointing this out.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 11, page 399</h2>
    <p>The bold paragraph contains the word "follow" in italic but not
    bold. The word should be both italic and bold.</p>
    
    <h2>Appendix A, page 418</h2>
    <p>The paragraph right after the bullet list contains "I've" and
      "don't" with straight apostrophes. They should use curly
      apostrophe, as in "<strong>I&#x2019;ve</strong>" and
      "<strong>don&#x2019;t</strong>".</p>
    <br/>
    <p>The paragraph right after the bullet list ends with '.:', it
      should end with just '.'.</p>

    <h2>Appendix A, page 422</h2>
    <p>In the second paragraph, the word "didn't" should use curly
    apostrophe "didn&#x2019;t"</p>

    <h2>Appendix B, page 425, answer 3.10</h2>
    <p>The second instance of "can't" uses straight apostrophe. It
    should use curly apostrophe as in "can&#x2019;t"</p>

    <h2>Appendix B, page 426, answer 4.9</h2>
    <p>The fifth numbered item uses fixed width font for the number
      "5". It should use the same style as the previous four
      items.</p>

    <h2>Appendix B, page 436, answers 9.9 and 9.10</h2>
    <p>The last sentence, "The node will thus never know ...", of
      answer 9.10 is misplaced. It should be the last sentence of
      answer 9.9.</p>

    <h2>Appendix B, page 437, answer 10.6</h2>
    <p>The word "can't" uses straight apostrophe. It should use curly
    apostrophe as in "can&#x2019;t"</p>

    <h2>Appendix B, page 438, answer 10.9</h2>
    <p>The typesetting of PKH<sub>Y</sub> should be all monospace, but
      the subscript is not.</p>

    <h2>Back cover</h2>
    <p>The author's company name is misspelled in the Author Bio. The
      correct spelling is <strong>Popeller</strong>.</p>
