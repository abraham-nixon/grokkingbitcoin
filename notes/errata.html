    <h2>Front matter, page xx, preface</h2>
    <p>The text "... trying to find a my place in the Bitcoin
      community ..." in the third paragraph should read "... trying to
      find <strong>a</strong> place in the Bitcoin community ..."</p>

    <h2>Table of contents</h2>
    <p>The section "Recap of payment types" is missing in the table of
      contents for chapter 10. It should be right before the "Block
      limits" section.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 2, page 33</h2>
    <p>In the first paragraph after figure 2.7, the apostrophe in the
      word "Let's" should be changed to a curly apostrophe, "Let’s".</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4, page 87</h2>
    <p>In the list of wallet duties, "Back up private
      key<strong>s</strong>" should be all italics. The
      trailing <strong>s</strong> is not.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4, page 111</h2>
    <p>The header "Public key multiplication" should be one level down
      under the "Public key math" header. The other headers under
      "Public key math" should remain, so that "Public key
      multiplication" is on the same level as for example "Why is this
      secure?".</p>

    <h2>Chapter 6, page 189</h2>
    <p>In the section "Verifying the partial merkle tree", the
      reference to figure 2.28 is wrong. It should reference figure
      6.28.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 9, page 320</h2>
    <p>In the paragraph directly preceeding figure 9.15, the figure
      reference "Figure 9.14" is wrong. It should say "Figure
      9.15".</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10, page 350</h2>
    <p>The sidebar titled "Nonstandard transactions" doesn't use curly
      apostrophes '’'.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 10, page 355</h2>
    <p>Last paragraph of section "Spending the p2wsh transaction" ends
      with a double period, "..". It should instead end with single
      period ".",</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10, page 362</h2>
    <p>The figure after Figure 10.34, is labeled as "Figure 10.3",
      when it should be labeled as "Figure 10.35"</p>

    <h2>Appendix A, page 418</h2>
    <p>The paragraph right after the bullet list contains "I've" and
      "don't" with straight apostrophes. They should use curly
      apostrophe, as in "<strong>I’ve</strong>" and
      "<strong>don’t</strong>"</p>
    
    <h2>Appendix A, page 418</h2>
    <p>The paragraph right after the bullet list ends with '.:', it
      should end with just '.'</p>

    <h2>Appendix B, page 436, answer 9.9 and 9.10</h2>
    <p>The last sentence, "The node will thus never know ...", of
      answer 9.10 is misplaced. It should be the last sentence of
      answer 9.9.</p>

    <h2>Back cover</h2>
    <p>The author's company name is misspelled in the Author Bio. The
      correct spelling is <strong>Popeller</strong>.</p>
