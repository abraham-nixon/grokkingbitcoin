Dear you!

Thank you for visiting the Open Source version of Grokking Bitcoin, a
book for technically curious people wanting to learn the deep basics
of Bitcoin.

We (he author, and Manning) have decided to release this book under
the Creative Commons license Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0
International (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

The decision was not straight forward. We have put thousands of hours
of work into this book, and it may seem contradictory to make it
freely available. After all, Manning want to see some returns on their
investment, and I would like to see some revenue from this book as
well. Summing up the good and subtracting the bad, we strongly believe
that open sourcing the book will end up on the positive side:

+ The book will be more well known, generating more sales through
word-of-mouth.

+ We hope to get more feedback.

+ You get to browse the (whole) book before you buy it. That makes it
  easier to take the leap to paying your hard earned money for
  it. Like flipping through the pages in a physical book store.

+ People with no financial possibility to buy the book can read it.

+ It aligns well with the openness of the Bitcoin community in
  general.

+ I want to give back to the community that has done so much for the
  success of Bitcoin.

The few drawbacks we can think of are:

- Possibly less eBook sales

- Harder to monitor the interest in the book

Some other factors are also at play. For example, there are other
Bitcoin books available under an open source license, that have proven
successful.

If you do read the open source version of the book, we kindly ask you
to give an honest review on one or more of your favorite online book
stores. This will help others make the right decision for them.

However you chose to read this book, we sincerely hope that you will
find it interesting and useful. Please let us know what you think.
